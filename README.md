cajo
====

Mavenized clone of https://svn.java.net/svn/cajo~svn r2663

Cajo is a very simple way to have two JVM's communicate.

The official java.net project seems to have stagnated, so 
I have cloned the project as of r2663 to get the ball rolling 
with Mavenization while trying to get hold of John Catherino.
