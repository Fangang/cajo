This package provides the base class resources used in the creation of
<a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>cajo</a> services and controllers.
Normally application specific classes would <i>not</i> be added to this
package. It also contains the Client class, used by remote clients, to
view the service's user interface, if it supports one.
