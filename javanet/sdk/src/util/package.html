This package provides the base class resources used in the creation of
<a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net>cajo</a> services and controllers.
Normally application specific classes would <i>not</i> be added to this
package. It also contains the Client class, used by remote clients, to
view the service's user interface, if it supports one.<br><br>

<i><b>NB:</b></i> It is also very simply possible to create a Client
application of your own, that lays out controller views from multiple
services. This was not included in the sdk for both brevity, and since most
applications of a multiple view frame are typically highly application
specific.
