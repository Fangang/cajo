The cajo package is used for transparent distributed computing between
remote Virtual Machines.<p>

It provides two primary services:<p>

<ul>
<li> To make objects remotely callable with no structural changes to the
objects themselves.<p>

<li> To allow applications to remote their user interfaces transparently,
as both applets, and via WebStart.<p>
</ul>

It allows Virtual Machines to dynamically distribute their functionality
across the network. It essentially creates a seamless continuum between
cooperating remote Virtual Machines, or in other words, creates a
composite <i>Virtual Virtual Machine</i>. (VVM)<p>

The <a href=gnu/cajo/invoke/package-summary.html>invoke</a> package is
common to all cooperating virtual machines. It allows one Virtual Machine to
<i>use</i> the functionality of another. While it consists of five classes,
only three are necessary in most cases. Two of these are interfaces, each
with less than five lines of code! <p>

The <a href=gnu/cajo/utils/package-summary.html>utils</a> package is a
collection of eight classes used to <i>furnish</i> functionality to remote
Virtual Machines. A typical application will use most, if not all, of these
classes.<p>

The <a href=gnu/cajo/utils/extra/package-summary.html> extra</a> package
provides some techniques for applying the framework. It is not critical to
understanding the framework, and as such should be reviewed last. It will
provide however, both useful supplemental functionality, and a set of
interesting examples of the power inherent in this architecture.<p>
