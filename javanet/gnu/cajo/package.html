<p>The <b>Grail</b> inteface defines the functionality for furnishing,
finding, and using objects; upon which to invoke procedure calls.

<p>The <b>Service</b> interface defines the cajo proxy model. Proxies are
objects, requested from the server or sent by a client, to interact with a
service object, in a local context for the client.
