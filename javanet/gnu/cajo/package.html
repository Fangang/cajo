This package dramatically streamlines the export and discovery of remotely
accessible objects. It provides a quick method to get new users <i>"up and
running."</i> From there, as the satisfaction is rising, one is ready to
begin to look into other features of the framework. It could be considered
a generalised overview of the capabilities of the framework.

<p>This package provides a usable high-level overview of the functionality
of the cajo project. The cajo functionality consists of two fundamental
pieces, these are represented by the Grail and Service classes

<p>The Grail class encapsulates furnishing and finding remote objects,
upon which to invoke specific procedure calls.

<p>The  Service class encapsulates the cajo proxy model. Proxies are objects
requested from the server, or sent by a client, to interact with the service
object.
