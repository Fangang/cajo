This package provides the two top-level interfaces to the functionality
of the cajo project. The cajo functionality consists of two fundamental
pieces, these are represented by the <b>Grail</b> and <b>Service</b>
<i>interfaces:</i>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Grail</b> inteface defines the functionality for furnishing,
finding, and using objects; upon which to invoke procedure calls.<p>

<li>The <b>Service</b> interface defines the cajo proxy model. Proxies are
objects, requested from the server or sent by a client, to interact with a
service object, in a local context for the client.
</ul>

<p>The Cajo class, and its helper classes, exist purely to implement the
Grail interface. It also provides one supplimental method, to manually
collect registry entries, in addition to the default dynamic
<i>(multicast)</i> mechanism.
