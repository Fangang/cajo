                           The cajo project is a small, free library, enabling powerful dynamic
                           multi-machine cooperation, both within, and between, Java applications. It
                           provides an easy-to-use, yet completely understandable framework to simplify
                           the use of RMI, while at the same time harnessing its <u>full</u> potential.
                           It is being successfully deployed on J2EE, J2SE, and J2ME environments.
                           It is particularly easy to add to existing programs, as it requires
                           <u><i>no</i></u> architectural redesign.

                           <h4>Project Goals</h4>

                           1. Establish a free simple distributed paradigm, which becomes increasingly
                           valuable with greater use.<br><br>

                           2. Encourage increased distributed inter-operation between applications, and
                           component libraries.<br><br>

                           3. Foster development of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452284392/qid=1102258432/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/002-5249030-9700002 title="highly recommended!" target=_blank>
                           scale-free</a> network components; creating flexible, resilient, and adaptive
                           applications.

                           <h4>Major Features</h4>

                           1. The framework allows any number of Java Virtual Machines to work together,
                           literally as one.  Application code makes absolutely no semantic distinction,
                           between local, and remote  objects. Applications can evolve from all objects
                           being on a single Virtual Machine, to all objects being on separate Virtual
                           Machines, to all objects being on separate Physical Machines. The scalability
                           comes via the framework; it requires <i><u>no</u></i> changes to the
                           application's code, or its structure.<br><br>

                           2. Unsigned applets, and Web Start applications, indistinguishable from
                           installed applications, can be created easily.  Simply transfer an
                           application's entire user interface, to any Java equipped client.  Cleanly
                           separate the computational components of the model, view, and controller
                           portions of an application, between multiple machines. Send both data and
                           code, with complete transparency, and security.<br><br>

                           3. This framework allows both applications, and developers, to collaborate
                           dynamically, linking their objects at will. This architecture can fulfill
                           the true promise of Java: Turn the network into one seamless, evolving
                           computer; link everything, from mainframes, to mobile phones. It can
                           allow applications to be easily built, using optimised components from
                           <i>other</i> distributed applications. Remoting and linking of objects can
                           be done with as little as <a href=overview.html>one</a> additional line of
                           code!

                           <h4>Getting Started</h4>

                           The framework consists of just two, very small packages:<ul><li>
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/package-summary.html>gnu.cajo.invoke</a>
                           (5 classes) defines the architectural core for clients
                           <li><a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/package-summary.html>gnu.cajo.utils</a>
                           (8 classes) applies this core for the creation of servers</ul>

                           The project has no dependencies on <u>any</u> other frameworks, and works
                           with <u>any</u> Java Runtime Environment; 1.2 or higher. This is critically
                           important, to include J2ME devices. Best of all, it uses: <i>No
                           bloody XML!<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font></i><br><br>

                           In general; there are two approaches to getting started:<br><br>

                           1. For those who want to fully understand the implementation of this
                           framework, first review the invoke package, it's surprisingly small. Next
                           move on to the utils package. This will make the provided
                           <a href=example.html>example</a> code both immediately understandable, and
                           quickly extensible. It's also an excellent way to learn about RMI, in detail.
                           A <a href=theory.html>theory</a> page has been provided, especially for this
                           group.<br><br>

                           2. For those who want to jump right in, and learn by doing, there is the
                           example package. It consists of just four small classes, yet completely
                           exercises the entire framework, and demonstrates its ease of use. The
                           project's root directory has batch files, and an Ant script, illustrating
                           three fundamentally different ways to build the application. The <a href=overview.html>
                           overview</a> page should be of particular interest to this group.<br><br>

                           <i><u>Note</u>:</i> links to all this information, and much more, can be
                           found on the left sidebar, under <b>Project tools</b>.<br><br>

                           Either way, after downloading the <a href=license.html>free</a> source code,
                           the next step would be to read the <a href=tutorial.html>tutorial</a>.

                           I hope you find it surprisingly easy to come up to speed. I also hope you
                           will find the new possibilities <i>very</i> exciting.  This framework is lean
                           and clean, and this project is not focused on making it larger. Rather, its
                           primary focus is on promoting its adoption into new, and existing,
                           applications. Naturally, improvements and fixes are <i>always</i> welcome,
                           from everyone. However, they <i>must</i> be backward compatible, to maintain
                           interoperability with existing applications.<br><br>

                           Once our member community reaches critical mass, I hope this site will
                           become a popular gathering place for developers. Until then, I will do my
                           best to handle any of your questions, comments, or ideas. I recommend using
                           the project's <a href=servlets/ProjectForumView>fora</a>, as I currently
                           subscribe to all of them. Migrate some of your favorite code, and let's
                           hear about the results. The <a href=servlets/ProjectNewsList>Announcements</a>
                           section will host the latest information about the project, and the
