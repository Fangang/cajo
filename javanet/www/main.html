                           <h2>Welcome to the cajo distributed framework.</h2>
                           The cajo project is a small, free library, licensed under the GNU LGPL,
                           enabling powerful, dynamic cooperation between Java applications. It
                           provides an easy-to-use, openly understandable framework, to simplify the
                           use of RMI, while harnessing its full potential.
                           <br><br><b>Goals of the project:</b><br><ul>
                              <li>Establish a standard paradigm, which becomes progressively more
                              valuable as more developers use it.
                              <li>Encourage increased practice of dynamic inter-operation between
                              applications.
                              <li>Foster development of scale-free application networks, where
                              functionality is flexible, resilient, and adaptive to loading.
                              <li>Encourage the development of <b>subprojects</b>! From CaJo Pong to
                              CaJo Quake, from CaJo Instant Messanger to CaJo P2P, and many other
                              interesting things. (Of course you don't really have to name them
                              that way! :-)
                           </ul>
                           The framework consists of just small packages; <b>gnu.cajo.invoke</b>
                           (5 classes) and <b>gnu.cajo.utils</b> (9 classes). For those who like to jump
                           in, and learn by doing, there is an example directory of 4 small classes fully
                           exercising the framework, and even shows the 3 major different ways to build
                           an application.<p>
                           For those who want to learn the ins-and-outs of the internal workings, the
                           invoke package defines the paradigm, and is the best place to start. The
                           utils package applies the invoke paradigm to create the framework.
                           <br><br><b>Other Notes:</b><br><br>
                           I am very excited to bring this project to the community. While I feel the
                           library is fairly mature at this time, this website is certainly in its
                           infancy. Please check back often. Ongoing documentation activity, combined
                           with community feedback, should make this site a work in process, for quite
                           some time to come.<br><br><br><br>
