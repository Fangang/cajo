                                      the case guys, I did it! And by the way, congratulations Eric, on your latest

                                      <li>Chris DiBona, your advice and encouragement really meant a lot to me at
                                      the start of this adventure.  Even before that, your <a href= http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/ target=_blank>
                                      book</a> was a pivotal inspiration. <u>Update</u>: I also look forward to
                                      reading the much appreciated <a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources2/>
                                      sequel</a>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Esmond Pitt (aka) ejp on the Sun Java RMI forum; for patiently answering
                                      my, and many others questions over the <i>years,</i> especially as they
                                      became more esoteric. Also for your outstanding <a href=http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=100000000013468 target=_blank>
                                      book</a>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Fredrik Larsen, who with assistance from project member
                                      Li Ma, '<i>changed the rules</i>' for Java reflection. Now, for the project's
                                      invoke paradigm: Subclass <i>and</i> subinterface arguments <i>will</i> be
                                      recognised.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Ekkehard Gentz; who demonstrated that the example
                                      needed a root properties file, to work on non-English localised machines. He
                                      also provided the example properties file, translated <i>auf Deutsch</i>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Jean-Marie Dautelle, for your experienced feedback to this project,
                                      and the generous contribution of an ant script, to build the framework.
                                      Jean-Marie heads <i>two</i> excellent open source projects. They provide
                                      classes and packages missing from core Java; for real-time, scientific, and
                                      safety-critical applications. I highly recommend a visit to learn more about
                                      both: <a href=http://jscience.org>JScience</a> <i>and</i> <a href=http://javolution.org>
                                      javolution</a>. He even provided the example properties file, translated
                                      <i>en fran&ccedil;ais</i>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Olivier Brizard, for your proposal to include support for HTTP proxy
                                      tunnels, as required by so many corporations. He both made the case,
                                      <i>and</i> validated its operation. For helping to foster a new era of
                                      cooperation, between fiercely firewalled corporations: <i>D&eacute;tente</i>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Zac Wolfe, for your proposal to manually autobox server
                                      method arguments, as needed during remote invocation. This allows server
                                      methods to use primitive argument types, in <i>addition</i> to primitive
                                      return types.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Martin Zardeki, for developing a technology adoption path
                                      for the JEE developer community. He created a detailed wiki <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/CajoServlet>
                                      page</a> to document the process, and also furnished complete <a href=http://cajo.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=4260&expandFolder=4260&folderID=0>
                                      source</a> code. Thanks for building a very valuable bridge, between two
                                      innovative communities.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Bharavi Gade, for your proposal to add JRE 1.3 dynamic
                                      object proxy support to the codebase. He very patiently made the case, past
                                      my initial objections. Now we can all enjoy the amazingly simple, yet
                                      extremely powerful, abstraction of the <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/TransparentItemProxy.html>
                                      TransparentItemProxy</a>.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Keith Oswald, who in concert with project member Pavel
                                      Krupets, recognised potential shortcomings in the ItemProxy / ClientProxy
                                      mechanism for JVMs behind firewalls. Based on their issues, and some
                                      extremely interesting commentary in the <a href=servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=428>
                                      Client/Server Computing</a> forum; this mechanism now works significantly
                                      better than ever.<br><br>

                                      <li>Mike Decker, who made <i>three</i> very significant contributions to
                                      our project. He recognised the need to have CodebaseServer able to serve
                                      application specific graphical clients. He also contributed to a generic
                                      Swing compatible proxy JClient. Finally he saw the need for having
                                      CodebaseServer able to support multiple jar classpaths. He did all this,
                                      and a considerable amount of testing as well. Together these refinements
                                      make the project much more appealing to sophisticated proxy GUI developers.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <li>Petr &#352;t&#283;p&#225;n, made two interesting contributions. First he
                                      proposed allowing objects exported by <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>
                                      Remote</a> to optionally support the <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/rmi/server/Unreferenced.html>
                                      Unreferenced</a> interface -- to receive notification each time the group of
                                      remote clients of the item reaches zero. Second he proposed <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/TransparentItemProxy.html>
                                      TransparentItemProxy</a> should unpack <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/InvocationTargetException.html>
                                      InvocationTargetException</a>s into the original exception thrown by the
                                      wrapped object method; this is a much more intuitive thing to do. Further
                                      explanation on the topic can be found <a href=http://benpryor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/24-Java-Dynamic-Proxies-and-InvocationTargetException.html>
                                      here</a>.
                                      <br><br>

                                      <li>Project member J&ouml;rg Hubschneider, who made the astute observation
                                      that the bind operations in <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ItemServer.html#bind(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.String)>
                                      gnu.cajo.utils.ItemServer</a> were not threadsafe. This could cause
                                      potentially disastrous exceptions in an highly dynamic application; wherein
                                      binding of items was performed in different threads. He also noticed that
                                      <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/AsyncMethod.html>
                                      AsyncMethod</a> would benefit from unpacking potential
                                      InvocationTargetExceptions too.<br><br>

                                      <li>Project member Bertrand G&ouml;tzmann, who provided three fascinating
                                      applications of scripting cajo using the Groovy language. The original
                                      french articles can be found <a href=http://www.odelia-technologies.com/cajo>
