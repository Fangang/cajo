                              <b>Supporting cajo proxy item servers.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           The
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a> could be
                           considered one of the world's smallest application server. It is completely
                           customized to support the cajo framework. The entire server consists of
                           a single class, yet it serves (no pun intended) two <i>major</i> purposes.

                           <h3>Codebase Service</h3><br>

                           When a proxy item is sent to another VM, it arrives solely as a serialized
                           collection of many cooperating objects, and no code (i.e. class files). The
                           receiving VM will first check in its local codebase to find class definitions
                           for these objects, if it does, it will use them. However, as is often the
                           case with proxies, it will not have the application specific classes needed
                           by the received proxy. When this happens, the RMI framework steps in; it will
                           call back to the item server, and request the class definitions. The primary
                           use of the CodebaseServer is to manage this transfer, and it does it
                           automatically and transparently. The necessary classes are provided to the
                           remote host, loaded into its runtime, and the proxy then operates locally in
                           the context of that VM.<br><br>

                           All proxy-specific class files, and other files needed by the proxy, such as
                           images or localized string tables, are packaged into a single jar file. The
                           next topic, <a href=example.html>example</a>, will illustrate a very easy way
                           to do this. The jar file will be sent, as requested by remote proxy hosts,
                           when reconstructing the proxy object in their runtimes.<br><br>

                           You will need a codebase server any time you are sending proxies to another
                           remote machine.  You will also need one if you are sending application
                           specific classes as arguments to a remote machine, even if you are not
                           sending proxy items per se.

                           <h3>Client Service</h3><br>

                           If the previous topic on <a href=client.html>client</a> loading seemed
                           almost magical, this is the function of an application server. The previous
                           discussion on codebase service could be provided by <u>any</u> general
                           purpose webserver. What makes an application server special is knowing what
                           to do with all that <i>'extra-stuff'</i> appended to the end of the URL.<br><br>

                           As explained previously, the CodebaseServer first checks if simply a jar file
                           is being requested, if so, it fulfills the request, very generic. However,
                           when the request is <i>not</i> for a jar file; here is where things get
                           interesting.<br><br>

                           The CodebaseServer will parse the URL to extract additional meaning from the
                           request. Based on its content, one of three things will happen. First, and
                           trivially, it may not understand the request, in this case, the request is
                           rejected. However, if the request is understood; now one of two things will
                           happen.<br><br>

                           If no exclamation point is terminates the request, the CodebaseServer will
                           interpret this as a request for the client to be run as an applet, inside the
                           requesting browser. If an exclamation point is appended, this will be
                           interpreted as a request for the client to be run as an application, on the
                           desktop of the requesting host. The provided arguments themselves are used to
                           configure the client for operation within the requester's VM, as explained in
                           the client topic. <i>Note:</i> the client is also contained in a separate jar
                           file. The CodebaseServer will also handle its transfer automatically.<br><br>

                           The client loading process is as follows:<ol>

                              <li>The host requests the client
                              <li>The CodebaseServer returns instructions on how to do this
                              <li>The host requests the client codebase
                              <li>The CodebaseServer provides this
                              <li>The host asks the server item for its proxy
                              <li>The server item provides this
                              <li>The host requests the codebase needed by the proxy
                              <li>The CodebaseServer provides this

                           </ol>An elaborate process, to be sure, but all handled transparently behind
                           the scenes. The code is all there, for the curious, but truth be told, like
                           the Java API source, you need not read it, in order to use it effectively.
                           This was only a high-level overview, for your edification, the
                           <i>mind-numbing</i> technical details were intentionally omitted. If this
                           already has your head spinning, don't worry about it; especially don't worry
                           about the next section, simply go on to the conclusion.

                           <h3>CodebaseServer Sharing</h3><br>

                           OK, for you <i>hot-shots</i> who want to squeeze out every last ounce of
                           performance, you probably already thought of this, but here it is anyway.
                           Because the CodebaseServer performs the functionality of a generic http
                           server, if you do not require the client application service functionality,
                           you can share another item's CodebaseServer. <i>Simply</i> place your proxy
                           jar file in the working directory of another CodebaseServer, and use the
                           fully-qualified constructor of the ItemServer, to tell clients where to
                           find the file. <i>Note:</i> The CodebaseServer need not even be in the same
                           physical box as the server item. Just ponder the implications of that :-)
                                                      
                           <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>

                           The CodebaseServer handles the low-level protocol details to make the cajo
                           framework run transparently. It allows a single client application to be
                           able to display any graphical proxy. Typically it is used in its application
                           server capacity, solely by a single VM, to support its shared items. Its
                           purpose is to bring the power of proxy items, and graphical proxy viewing to
                           everybody, not just the <i>rocket-scientists</i>.
