               The TestItem class demonstrates the basic functionality of a server item. A
               server item has two primary components; a processing thread, and a callable
               interface.  While the processing thread is technically optional, a callable
               interface is logically essential. The processing thread, if defined, is
               launched automatically, following binding of the object with the <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ItemServer.html>
               ItemServer</a>. A server item can also be purely <i>event driven</i>; i.e.
               only executing when its callable methods are being invoked; in this case it
               would not define a <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseItem.MainThread.html>
               MainThread</a> object. The callable interface to an item is simply its
               collection of publicly declared methods. (subject to the minor restrictions
               outlined in the <a href="theory.html#rules">theory</a> page)<br><br>

               The thread in the example item performs the <i>highly recommended</i>
               practice of looping on its <tt>thread.isInterrupted()</tt> method. The
               item itself, or other parts of the application, can invoke a
               <tt>thread.interrupt()</tt> on the public thread member.  This does
               <b>not</b> terminate the thread automatically, rather only flags it. This
               allows item's processing thread a mechanism to perform a safe and orderly
               shutdown.  This is generally done when taking a server item offline. This
               technique has the added benefit that if the item's thread is waiting, it
               will wake it up, via the throwing of an <tt>InterruptedException</tt><br><br>

               Since this is only an example item implementation, the main processing thread
               has basically nothing to do.  So it simply puts itself to sleep, to be awoken
               should something interesting happen.  When awoken, it sleeps for 500
               milliseconds, to <i>appear</i> that it is doing something.  Following that,
               it invokes the method "callback" on an item reference it gets from
               <i>somewhere</i>, (actually one of its own methods, described next) passing a
               string argument, and displaying the result.  It then loops back up into sleep.
               That's all it does, until interrupted, if ever.<br><br>

               The interesting part happens in its public callback method.  It is
               appropriately named, though it actually could be named anything.  When it is
               invoked, it saves the reference to the presumably remote calling item, and
               wakes its main thread, to operate as described in the previous paragraph. It
               then prints the message provided by the invoking item, and returns a string
               indicating synchronous acknowlegement. Again, the critical point is; every
               public method an item declares will be invokable from remote items, no
               differently than if it was being interfaced  by local objects. <i>Note:</i>
               this implementation also intentionally illustrates the importance of
               reentrancy consideration with regard to an item's public interface. If many
               items invoke this method simultaneously, only the last caller will get called
               back by the item's main thread.  Making the example's callback method
               threadsafe is left as a mental excercise for the reader.<br><br>

               Lastly, the item implements the <tt>toString</tt> method, inherited from
               <tt>Object</tt>.  This is also a <i>highly recommended</i> practice.  In
               this case, it is used when monitoring the item, which is covered in the
               upcoming section on <a href="#Main">Main</a>, and also greatly aids in
               debugging. Being public, note that the method is also remotely callable, to
               identify the object at the other end of the remote reference.  That's all
               there is to the TestItem example.

               The TestProxy class is a small proxy item illustrating many features of the
               framework.  It is sent to a client, as the return from the TestItem's <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseItem.html#getProxy()>
               getProxy</a> method, inherited from <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseItem.html>
               BaseItem</a>. The proxy automatically inherits a remote reference to the
               TestItem.  On arrival at the client, it is initialized (by the client) with
               the assignment of its remoteThis member with a reference to the proxy itself,
               remoted the context of the client VM.  This initialization, will cause the
               proxy's main thread to start, if it has one. As with server items; a proxy
               need not define a main thread, i.e. it can also be purely <i>event driven</i>.<br><br>

               The example demonstrates the Internationalization feature of proxies.
               When the proxy is initialized, it will load its string table, if defined,
               from a properties file, most closely matching the locale of the receiving VM.
               This allows the proxy's user interface to be in German on an Austrian machine,
               and Spanish on a Mexican one, for example.  Of course, all of these
               translated string tables must be provided.  The properties file, and all
               other non-class resources are generally placed in a support directory.  In
               this case it is called include. The reason for the separate directory, is to
               simplify the proxy's jar creation, as the build script can then include all
               the files in the directory blindly.<br><br>

               Since this is a graphical proxy example, it's initialization invocation also
               returns a non-null graphical component that the client can display on its
               monitor. The purpose of the component is to provide a graphical user
               interface to a remote server item, however offloading as much processing as
               necessary, to the client's runtime.<br><br>

               When the proxy's processing thread starts, it writes out an arrival notice
               to the client's user interface.  Next, it invokes the method named callback
               on the reference to its server item.  It passes its remote reference to
               itself, and a message string.  It displays the value returned  by the
               invocation as well.  Following that, it exits its run method, causing its
               main processing thread to terminate.<br><br>

               The proxy has a public method named callback. When called, in this case by
               the TestProxy, it will display the incoming text argument, and send back a
               synchronous text acknowlegement of its own. Just as with server items, all
               of a proxy's public methods, can be called by remote items, or proxies,
               having a reference to the proxy.

               The Builder class serves two purposes:<br><br>

               First it serves to replace all the code which would otherwise go into the
               proxy's constructor.  Why do this? Because all of the construction code,
               which can be quite sizeable if the proxy is elaborate, can be left out of
               the proxy's jar file.  This reduces the proxy jar size, and also adds the
               additional security that the proxy becomes much more difficult to
               <i>reverse-engineer</i>, if such protection is important to you.<br><br>

               The second function of the Builder class is to instantiate the proxy, then
               serialize its image to disc.  This serialized object will be included in the
               proxy jar file, and referenced through a <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ProxyLoader.html>
               ProxyLoader</a> in the TestItem's runtime.  This is the <i>most elaborate</i>
               way to use a ProxyLoader. They can also be used to invoke a proxy's no-arg
               constructor, to create a new instance of the proxy, on its arrival at the
               host VM. In that case, all of the construction code would have to be passed
               to the client VM. Use of a ProxyLoader is optional, but it is a <i>highly
               recommended</i> optimization as it prevents having to load full proxies into
               the server item runtime.<br><br>

               The actual mechanics of what is going on inside the builder is not so
               important.  It is basically configuring graphical components, and putting
               them into the graphical user interface member object <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseProxy.html#container>
               container</a>. The proxy will return this graphical container to the hosting
               client as a result of its initialization invocation.  It also defines the
               keys of the string table, also loaded during initialization. It references a
               ProxyLoader, this is a special requirement.  The proxy will need to use the
               ProxyLoader class file on its arrival at the host, however, it doesn't need
               to use one at compile time.  Without this apparently unused reference, the
               proxy would suffer a <tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt> at the host, as
               ProxyLoader class would not be in the proxy jar file, as it would have not
               been compiled.

               The Main class illustrates how to make a server application.  A server is
               simply an application which makes one or more items available for remote
               invocation. The Main class first configures its network settings, then makes
               the test item accessible.  As explained in the <a href=tutorial.html#launching>
               launching</a> turorial, the application can take up to five parameters, in
               order, from most likely to need changing, to least likely, and where order
               and precedence matters. The network configuration parameters are as follows:

               <ul>
                  <li> the port number on which to serve the proxy's codebase <br>(default = 80)
                  <li> the port number on which to communicate with the item <br>(default = 1099)
                  <li> the external server name or address, if using NAT <br>(default = same as local)
                  <li> the local host network interface, if multiple <br>(default = all interfaces)
                  <li> the outside port number to communicate with the item <br>(default = same as local)
               </ul>

               The server also does a few additional actions, to illustrate the operation of
               remaining parts of the framework.  It multicasts a remote reference to itself
               to announce its startup.  It uses a <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/MonitorItem.html>
               MonitorItem</a>, to log data about the remote invocations to its item to the
               system console.  It even listens for other item announcements; sending the
               announcers a remote reference the test proxy, invoked on their setProxy
               method, if they have one. Finally it finishes up by listing its configuration
               information.  This can be useful if the server is told to use any anonymous
               TCP ports (i.e. port = 0), the info will contain the actual port numbers
               chosen by the operating system at startup.

               The example illustrates a common use of the cajo framework:
               <blockquote>
               <i>String -> remote reference -> local proxy -> GUI</i>
               </blockquote>
               1. A URL defines a remote object reference; either at another server, or
               serialised to disc.<br><br>

               2. The URL is deserialised into the local runtime, as a reference to the
               remote object.<br><br>

               3. A local proxy object is requested from the remote reference.<br><br>

               4. A GUI is requested from the proxy, to be the View, to its Controller
               functionality.<br><br>

               This allows the provision of sophisticated visual modules, which can be
               <i>composed</i> to yield even richer functionality. The components are neatly
               modularised by server. A single server may serve <i>several</i> graphical
               interfaces. These interfaces can be viewed with an ordinary web browser, or
               via Web Start.<br><br>

               <i>Note:</i> The <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ZippedProxy.html>ZippedProxy</a>
               class is the only utility class not used in the example. This is bacause the
               example demonstrates indirectly referencing a proxy, by the serving item.
               This is indicated when the server item, does not need to configure a proxy
               before sending it.  This can save a lot of space in the server item's runtime,
               especially if the proxy is very large, or if a single VM is serving many
               proxies.<br><br>

               In cases, when a proxy <i><u>must</u></i> be loaded into the server's VM;
               presumably for some runtime dependent configuration, it is <i>highly</i>
               recommended to use a ZippedProxy.  It compresses the serialized image of
               the proxy as it is sent to the hosting VM. This is done to reduce the amount
               of data, and transmission time, required to send the proxy.  If the proxy
               image is large, the network uplink is slow, or the cost per byte sent is high,
               this technique makes tremendous sense.  Its use is recommended for <u>all</u>
               proxies loaded into the server, as a general paradigm.
