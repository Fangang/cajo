                              <b>Demonstrating the framework's features and functions.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           The example package is a collection of four short classes demonstrating the
                           use of the framework.  It involves all the classes of the framework, except
                           one, and that one will be described at the <a href=example.html#Extras>end</a>
                           of the document, as well as why it was not part of the example.<br><br>
                           The four example classes are as follows:

                           <ul>
                              <li><a href=example.html#TestItem>TestItem</a> -- An introductory server item
                              <li><a href=example.html#TestProxy>TestProxy.java</a> -- An introductory server item proxy
                              <li><a href=example.html#Builder>Builder.java</a> -- To configure and serialize the example proxy
                              <li><a href=example.html#Main>Main.java</a> -- To launch the example server application
                           </ul>

                           As mentioned in the <a href=proxy.html>proxy</a> page, a server does not
                           need to use proxies, one is included in the example, for completely
                           illustrative purposes.<br><br>

                           The <a href=example.html#TestItem name=TestItem>TestItem</a> class is
                           demonstrates the basic functionality of a server item.  A server item has two
                           primary components; a processing thread, and a callable interface.  While the
                           processing thread is technically optional, a callable interface is logically
                           essential. The processing thread, if defined, is launched automatically
                           following construction of the object. If the server item wishes to be purely
                           <i>event driven</i>; i.e. only operating when its interface methods are being
                           called, its would not define a <code>MainThread</code> object.<br><br>

                           The thread in the example item performs the <i>highly recommended</i> practice
                           of looping on its <code>thread.isInterrupted()</code> method. The item itself,
                           or other parts of parts of the application, can invoke a <code>
                           thread.interrupt()</code> on the public thread member.  This does not
                           terminate the thread automatically, rather only flags it. This allows item's
                           processing thread a mechanism to perform a safe and orderly shutdown.  This
                           is generally done when taking a server item offline.<br><br>

                           Since this is only an example item implementation, the main processing thread
                           has nothing to do.  So it simply puts itself to sleep, to be awoken should
                           something interesting happen.  When awoken, it sleeps for 500
                           milliseconds, to <i>appear</i> that it is doing something.  Following that
                           it invokes a callback to an item reference it gets from <i>somewhere</i>
                           (actually one of its own methods) and invokes the method "callback" on this
                           reference, passing a string argument, and displaying the result.  It then
                           loops back up into sleep. That's all it does, until interrupted, if ever.<br><br>

                           The interesting part happens in its callback method.  It is appropriately
                           named, though it could be named anything.  When it is invoked, it saves
                           the reference to the, presumably remote, item and wakes the item's main
                           thread. It prints the message provided by the invoking item, and returns a
                           string indicating synchronous acknowlegement.  Every public method this
                           item declares will be invokable from remote items, no differently than if
                           it was interfaced  by local objects. <i>Note:</i> this implementation also
                           illustrates the importance of <u>reentrancy</u> concerns.  If many items
                           invoke this method simultaneously, only the last caller will be called back.<br><br>

                           Lastly, the item implements the <code>toString</code> method, inherited from
                           <code>Object</code>.  This is also <i>highly recommended</i>.  In this case,
                           it aids when monitoring the item, covered in the section on
                           <a href=example.html#Main>Main.java</a>, and greatly aids in debugging. That's
                           all there is to the <code>TestItem</code> example.<br><br>

                           The <a href=example.html#TestProxy name=TestProxy>TestProxy</a> class is a
                           small, proxy, illustrating many features of the framework.  It will be sent
                           to a client, on invocation of the TestItem's <code>getProxy</code> method it
                           inherited from <code>BaseItem</code>.  The proxy inherits a remote reference
                           to the TestItem, assigned by the ProxyLoader.  It is next initialized at the
                           client, with the assignment of its remoteThis member with a reference to the
                           proxy itself, remoted the context of the client VM.  This initialization,
                           will causee the proxy's main thread to start, if it has one.  As with server
                           items, a proxy need not define a main thread, i.e. it can also be purely
                           event driven.<br><br>

                           The example demonstrates the Internationalization feature of the framework.
                           When the proxy is initialized, it will load its string table from a
                           properties file most closely matching the locale of the receiving VM.  This
                           allows the proxy's user interface to be in German on an Austrian machine, and
                           Spanish on a Mexican one.  Of course, all of these translated string tables
                           must be provided.  The properties file, and all other non-class resources are
                           generally placed in a support directory.  In this case it is called include.
                           The reason for the separate directory, is to simplify the proxy's jar
                           creation as the build script can include all the files blindly.<br><br>

                           When the proxy's processing thread first starts, it writes out an arrival
                           notice to the client's user interface.  Next, it invokes the method named
                           callback on the reference to its server item.  It passes its remote reference
                           to itself, and a message string.  It displays the value returned  by the
                           invocation as well.  Following that, it exits its run method, causing its
                           processing thread to terminate.<br><br>

                           The proxy has a public method named callback. Just as with all of its public
                           methods, this can be called by remote items.  When called by the TestProxy,
                           it will display the incoming text argument, and send back a synchronous
                           text acknowlegement of its own.<br><br>

                           The <a href=example.html#Builder name=Builder>Builder</a> class serves two
                           purposes.  First it serves to replace the code which would normally go into
                           the proxy's constructor.  Why do this?  Because all of the construction code,
                           which can be quite a sizeable amount if the proxy is elaborate, can be left
                           out of the proxy's jar file.  This reduces the proxy jar size, can and also
                           add the additional feature that a proxy becomes much more difficult to
                           reverse-engineer, when such a protection is important.<br><br>

                           The second function of the Builder class is to instantiate the proxy, then
                           serialize its image to disc.  This serialized object will be included in the
                           proxy jar file, referenced through a <code>ProxyLoader</code> on the
                           TestItem's side.  The is the most elaborate way to use a ProxyLoader, it can
                           also be used to invoke a proxy's no-arg constructor, to create a new instance
                           of the proxy, on its arrival at the host VM.<br><br>

                           The actual mechanics of what is going on inside the builder is not so
                           important.  It is basically configuring graphical components, and putting
                           them into the graphical user interface member object <code>container</code>.
                           The proxy will return this graphical container to the hosting client as a
                           result of its initialization invocation.  It also defines the keys of the
                           string table, to be loaded during initialization. It also references a
                           ProxyLoader.  This is a special situation.  The proxy will need to use the
                           ProxyLoader class file on its arrival at the host, however, it doesn't need
                           to reference it during compile time.  Without this reference, the proxy
                           would suffer a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> at the host,
                           ProxyLoader would not have been loaded into the proxy jar file.<br><br>

                           The <a href=example.html#Main name=Main>Main</a> class illustrates how to
                           make a server application.  A server is simply an application which makes
                           one, or more, items available for remote invocation. The <code>Main</code>
                           class first configures the network settings, then makes the test item
                           accessible.  As explained in the <a href=tutorial.html#launching>launching
                           </a>turorial the application can take up to five parameters, in order,
                           from most likely to least likely to need changing, and where precedence
                           matters:

                           <ul>
                              <li> the port number on which to serve the proxy's codebase (default = 80)
                              <li> the port number on which to communicate with the item (default = 1099)
                              <li> the external server name or address, if using NAT (default = same as local)
                              <li> the local host network interface, if multiple (default = primary NIC)
                              <li> the outside port number to communicate with the item (default = same as local)
                           </ul>

                           The server also does a few additional actions, to illustrate the operation of
                           remaining parts of the framework.  It multicasts a remote reference to itself
                           to announce its startup.  It installs a monitor item, to log data about the
                           remote invocations, and system state of the server item, to the system
                           console.  It even listens for other item announcements, sending the
                           announcer's remote reference the test proxy, invoked on its setProxy method,
                           if it has one. Finally it finishes up by listing its configuration
                           information.  This can be helpful if the server is told to use anonymous
                           ports, the info will contain the port numbers chosen by the system at startup.<br><br>

                           The <a href=example.html#Extras name=Extras>ZippedProxy</a> class is the
                           only utility class not used in the example.  This is bacause the example
                           demonstrated indirectly referencing a proxy by the serving item.  This is
                           recommended when the server item, does not need to configure a proxy before
                           sending it.  This can save a lot of space in the server item's runtime, if
                           the proxy is very large, or if a single VM is serving many proxies.<br><br>

                           In cases, when a proxy <i>must</i> be loaded into the server's VM; presumably
                           for some runtime dependent configuration, then it is <i>strongly recommended</i>
                           to use a <code>ZippedProxy</code>.  It compresses the serialized image of the
                           proxy as it is sent to the hosting VM.  This is done to reduce the amount of
                           data, and transmission time, required to send the proxy.  If the network link is
                           slow, or the cost per bit is high, this approach makes tremendous sense.  It
                           is recommended to use it under all circumstances as a general paradigm.<br><br>
