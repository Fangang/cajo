                           This framework is licensed under the GNU LGPL, the technical <i>legalese</i> can be
                           found <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html target=_blank>here</a>.
                           The short, <i>human-readable</i>
                           <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html#SEC2 target=_blank>preamble</a>
                           is definitely worth reading.

                           <br><br>Let me summarise the two most important parts:<br>

                           <ul>
                              <li>This license grants you the right to use this code in your applications,
                              without payment of any royalties to the copyright holder; he being me.
                              <br><br>
                              <li>In a feature not present in the regular
                              <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html target=_blank>GPL</a>; you have
                              the right to use this library in proprietary applications, without having to
                              make the combined code free.
                           </ul>

                           Now, many will argue that this second point makes the license
                           "<a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html target=_blank>less
                           free</a>" than the GPL, in fact I also agree that it does.  However, this
                           framework has its greatest opportunity to influence application development,
                           if it is a resource for <u>all</u> developers, not just the free ones. Just
                           as with its objects; this framework allows its developers to work together,
                           whether they have the option to make their code free or not.
                           <br><br>

                           The license does impose one important provision however; which in order to
                           use this code, you must also abide:
                           <blockquote>
                              If you modify or extend the gnu.cajo classes, or rename them, or their
                              packages; both the resulting classes and packages must <i>also</i> be
                              licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL.
                           </blockquote>
                           This requirement is simply to keep this code, and all its future enhancements,
                           free for everyone; to use, to extend, and to share.<br><br><br>

                           <img src=images/cajo.png align=left>&nbsp&nbsp Finally, you are both welcomed,
                           and encouraged to show your support for this project, by using this button; on
                           webpages, documentation, and products. Of course it is purely optional,
                           and also <u>free</u>. On a webpage, a tag could written as simply as this:<br>
