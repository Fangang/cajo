                           This framework is licensed under the GNU LGPL, the technical <i>legalese</i> can be
                           found <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html target=_blank>here</a>.
                           The short, <i>human-readable</i>
                           <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html#SEC2 target=_blank>preamble</a>
                           is definitely worth reading.

                           <br><br>Let me summarise the two most important parts:<br>

                           <ul>
                              <li>This license grants you the right to use this code in your applications,
                              without payment of any royalties to the copyright holder; he being I.
                              <br><br>
                              <li>In a feature not present in the regular
                              <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html target=_blank>GPL</a>; you have
                              the right to use this library in proprietary applications, without having to
                              make the combined code free.
                           </ul>

                           Many will argue that this second point makes the license
                           "<a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html target=_blank>less
                           free</a>" than the GPL; in fact I also believe that it does.  However, this
                           framework has its greatest opportunity to influence application development
                           if it is a resource for <u>all</u> developers, not just the free ones. Just
                           as with its objects, this framework allows all of its developers to work
                           together; whether they have the option to make their code free or not.<br><br>

                           This license does impose an important provision however; which in order to
                           use this code, you must also agree:
                           <blockquote>
                              If you modify the gnu.cajo classes or the interfaces, or the packages;
                              if you add classes or interfaces to the packages, or create subpackages:
                              The resulting packages must also be provided under the <i>same</i> terms of
                              the GNU LGPL, or if you prefer, the GNU GPL. <i>However</i>; extending the
                              classes or implementing the interfaces in <i>different</i> packages, is
                              <i><b>not</b></i> subject to this provision.
                           </blockquote><br>

                           <img src=images/cajo.png align=left>&nbsp&nbsp Finally, you are both
                           welcomed, and encouraged to easily identify your application's distributed
                           capability by using this button; on webpages, in documentation, and for
                           products. Of course it is purely optional, and also <u>free</u>. On a
                           webpage, a tag could be as simple as this:<br>

<pre>
&lt;a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/index.html&gt;
    &lt;img src=https://cajo.dev.java.net/images/cajo.png&gt;
