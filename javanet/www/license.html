                           This framework is licensed under the GNU LGPL, the technical <i>lawyerese</i>
                           can be found <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html target=_blank>
                           here</a>. The short, <i>human-readable</i> <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html#SEC2 target=_blank>
                           preamble</a>, is definitely worth reading.

                           <br><br>Let me summarise the two most important parts:<br>

                           <ul>
                              <li>This license grants you the right to use this code in your applications,
                              without payment of any royalties to the copyright holder; he being I.
                              <br><br>
                              <li>In a feature not present in the regular
                              <a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html target=_blank>GPL</a>; you have
                              the right to use this library in proprietary applications, without having to
                              make the combined code free.
                           </ul>

                           Many will argue that this second point makes the license
                           "<a href=http://www.fsf.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html target=_blank>less
                           free</a>" than the GPL. However, I believe this framework has its greatest
                           opportunity to influence application development if it is a resource for
                           <u>all</u> developers, not just the free ones. Just as with its objects, this
                           framework allows all of its developers to work together; whether they have
                           the option to make their code free or not.<br><br>

                           The license does impose an important provision however; which in order to
                           use this code, you must also agree:
                           <blockquote>
                              If you modify the gnu.cajo classes, its interfaces, or its packages;
                              if you add classes or interfaces to its packages, or create subpackages:
                              The resulting packages if sold, or given away, must also be licensed
                              under the terms of the GNU LGPL. <i>Note:</i> extending the classes and
                              implementing the interfaces in <u>your</u> packages, are <i><b>not</b></i>
                              subject to this provision.
                           </blockquote><br>

                           <img src=images/cajo.png align=left>&nbsp&nbsp Finally, you are both
                           welcomed, and encouraged to identify your application's distributed
                           capability by using this button; on webpages, in documentation, and for
                           products. Of course it is purely optional, and also <u>free</u>. On a
                           webpage, a tag could be as simple as this:<br>

<pre>
&lt;a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/index.html&gt;
