                           This page will stand as a living document, fueled by the feedback of
                           developers.  It's easy to become highly proficient at this library, and
                           completely forget all the initial frustrations in getting it to work the
                           first time.  Therefore, I would like to ask the community to please send
                           in reports of odd things that have gone wrong.  Often these <i>'pearls from
                           tears'</i> can be as useful for learning as the source documentation itself.

                           <br><br>In that spirit, I'll do the honor of the first one...<br><br>

                           
                           <b><u>Argument Types:</u>
                           <strike></b> When executing an inovke method on an item,
                           Java reflection requires the argument types to match exactly.  Unfortunately
                           reflection does not recognize inheritance trees.  For example, if class B
                           extends class A, and an item method declares an argument of type A, you
                           cannot send it an object of type B and have it work!-(  This results in the
                           much dreaded <b><code>NoSuchMethodException</code></b>; if you haven't got
                           one yet, you probably will soon.  This gotcha can be so inconvienient that
                           the framework makes a special case for Objects extending the Invoke
                           interface.  They are always typecast into Invoke. Therefore: to receive a
                           local, remote, or proxy item reference, a method signature must declare
                           the argument to be of type Invoke.</strike><br><br>

                           <u><b>*What wonderful news!</b></u> Today (08-Jan-04) a <i>significant</i>
                           improvement to the project codebase was uploaded, which completely
                           <u>eliminates</u> this <i>"gotcha"</i>. It was most generously provided by
                           project member <b>frelars</b> (aka Fredrik Larsen), with assistance by
                           project member <b>li_ma</b> (aka Li Ma). It will traverse argument
                           inheritance trees to find the best fitting method. It is a 'stunning'
                           improvement, and removes the <u>most common problem</u> encountered by users.
                           <b>Well done!</b><br><br>

                           <b><u>Long delays:</u></b> When a remote invocation takes a really long time
                           for everything, there is a common problem.  RMI attempts to do a reverse-DNS
                           lookup before each invocation. In theory, this is for security purposes. When
                           trying to match IP addresses to host names, a DNS timeout can add up to
                           several minutes to each invocation. If you do not have a DNS server to
                           resolve the addresses to names, it is necessary to revert back to the <i>'old
                           way'</i>, i.e. the hosts file.  This is a text file containing address/host
                           name pairs, which the system will check first, before attempting a DNS lookup
                           over the network.<br><br>

                           On *nix boxes (Solaris/Unix/Linux/BSD) the file is typically located at:
                           <b>/etc/hosts</b><br>
                           On Windows boxes, it is usually: <b>\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</b><br><br>

                           Here you would put the IP address/host name pairs for the machines involved,
                           which do not have a DNS support.<br><br>
