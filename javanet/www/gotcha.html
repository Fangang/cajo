                                     inovke method on an item, Java reflection requires the argument types to
                                     match exactly.  Unfortunately reflection does not recognize inheritance
                                     trees.  For example, if class B extends class A, and an item method declares
                                     an argument of type A, you cannot send it an object of type B and have it
                                     work!-(  This results in the much dreaded <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>;
                                     if you haven't got one yet, you probably will soon.  This gotcha can be so
                                     inconvienient that the framework makes a special case for Objects extending
                                     the Invoke interface.  They are always typecast into Invoke. Therefore: to
                                     receive a local, remote, or proxy item reference, a method signature must
                                     declare the argument to be of type Invoke.</strike><br><br>

                                     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>*<u>Update</u>:</b> (08-Jan-04) A
                                     <i>significant</i> improvement to the project codebase was uploaded, which
                                     <u>eliminates</u> this <i>"gotcha"</i>. It was most generously proposed by
                                     project member <b>frelars</b> (aka Fredrik Larsen), with assistance by project
                                     member <b>li_ma</b> (aka Li Ma). It will traverse argument inheritance trees
                                     to find the best fitting method. It is a <i>stunning</i> improvement, and
                                     removes the most <u>common</u> problem encountered by users. Well done!<br><br>

                                     <a id="2"></a><b><u>2. Long delays:</u></b> When each remote invocation takes
                                     a really long time to execute, there is a common problem.  RMI attempts to
                                     do a reverse-DNS lookup before each invocation. In theory, this is for
                                     security purposes, so there is no way to disable it. The problem is; when
                                     trying to match IP addresses to host names, a DNS timeout can add up to
                                     several minutes to each invocation. If you do not have a DNS server to
                                     resolve the addresses to names, say on a private LAN for instance, it will be
                                     necessary to revert back to the <i>'old way'</i>, i.e. the hosts file.  This
                                     is a text file containing address/host name pairs, which the operating system
                                     will check first, before attempting a DNS lookup.<br><br>

                                     On *nix-type boxes (Solaris/Linux/BSD/OSX...) the file is typically:
                                     /etc/hosts<br>
                                     On Windows boxes, it is usually: \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts<br><br>

                                     Here you would put the IP address/host name pairs for the machines, which do
                                     not have DNS support.<br><br>

                                     <a id="3"></a><b><u>3. Network Realities:</u></b> While it is very simple to
                                     write code without regard to locality or remoteness of objects, it is very
                                     important to remember that any remote invocation can fail, or block for a
                                     very long time, if there is a problem with the network, or the target machine
                                     is unresponsive. The invoke interface is declared to throw an exception for
                                     two good reasons: One is logical, i.e. the invocation is invalid; the other
                                     is genuinely exceptional, i.e. something completely unexpected happened.<br><br>

                                     These realities can be managed in three different ways: First, when dealing
                                     with a remote item reference, your code should be prepared for unexpected
                                     network exceptions, and long transaction delays. Second, a proxy can be sent
                                     which manages these error conditions when calling its remote sender. (This
                                     makes life very nice for the user) Third, when it absolutely positively
                                     cannot go wrong, a proxy can be sent containing all of its necessary
                                     functionality, making little to no use of its remote link back to its
                                     sender.<br><br>

                                     Lastly, I find it extremely helpful to print, frame, memorize, and post
                                     somewhere near your monitor, the eight <a href=http://weblogs.java.net/jag/Fallacies.html>

                                     <a id="4"></a><b><u>4. Firewalled Clients:</u></b> Very often a client item
                                     is operating behind a firewall that prohibits inbound socket connections. If
                                     server callbacks are necessary for the design, this posed a real problem. A
                                     solution to this issue is provided through two specialised classes in the
                                     gnu.cajo.utils.extra package. The <a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ClientProxy.html>
                                     ClientProxy</a> object is used to locally represent a callable reference to
                                     the client, item in the server address space. A server would instantiate a ClientProxy, and pass a remote
                                     reference to it to the client. The client would then combine that reference,
                                     with a reference to the local item in an <a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ItemProxy.html>
                                     ItemProxy</a> object. This transparent approach allows object design for both
                                     servers and clients, without regard for the firewall issue. To see a simple
                                     example application, please visit our <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/FirewalledClients>

                                     <a id="5"></a><b><u>5. Marshalling Objects:</u></b> Sometimes, when sending
                                     large objects, particularly those which are a large graph of objects,
                                     exceptions can randomly occur during serialisation. While this is not a
                                     defect in the framework, it can be very annoying. One particularly helpful
                                     technique is for the sender to encapsulate the object in a
                                     <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/MarshalledObject.html>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</a>.
                                     Then the receiver can retrieve the original object using its
                                     <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/MarshalledObject.html#get()>get()</a>
                                     method. Encapsulating objects this way seems to make them far less prone to
                                     failure during transmission. The reason why this failure occurs, and even why
                                     this technique helps to fix it, is still a mystery.<br><br>

                                     <a id="6"></a><b><u>6. Sending Proxies:</u></b> Proxy objects, when sent
                                     from remote objects, nearly always arrive in a Marshalled Object. There is a
                                     <i>very</i> important reason for this. A proxy is an object, whose codebase
                                     is typically foreign to its hosting VM. When a proxy is extracted,
                                     via the <tt>get</tt> method of MarshalledObject, its remote codebase will
                                     be automatically loaded to instantiate the proxy, the location is
                                     contained <i>within</i> the MarshalledObject. The proxy now exists, but no longer
                                     has information about where its codebase came from. If you try to send the
                                     proxy object itself to another VM, the receiver will most likely suffer a
                                     <tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt>. However sending the MarshalledObject
                                     instead, will work correctly. MarshalledObjects are handy containers in which
                                     proxy objects can be freely sent between remote objects.<br><br>

                                     mechanism to provide a <i>useful-guess</i> at TCP configuration has now
                                     been added. If you do not explicitly configure Remote, it will now
                                     remote automatically, on an <i>anonymous</i> port. The actual port, selected
                                     from the unused pool by the OS at runtime, can be identified by calling
                                     Remote.<a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html#getServerPort>getServerPort</a>.
                                     It is effectively an implicit call to Remote.<a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html#config(java.lang.String,%20int,%20java.lang.String,%20int)>config(null, 0, null, 0)</a>.<br><br>

                                     <a id="8"></a><b><u>8. Excessive Decomposition:</u></b> The interfaces to
                                     remote objects should tend to favor functional richnes, over logical
                                     abstraction. Unlike an all-local object application, a remote procedure call
                                     is a temporally expensive activity. This <i>strongly</i> favors the creation
                                     of much <i>fewer</i> interface objects, with more functionally complete
                                     methods, to be used when remoting. In other words: <i>Export trees,
                                     <u>not</u> leaves."</a>
