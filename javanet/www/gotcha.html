                                     <a id="1"></a><b><u>1. Long delays:</u></b> When each remote invocation takes
                                     a really long time to execute, there is a common problem.  RMI attempts to
                                     do a reverse-DNS lookup before each invocation. In theory, this is for
                                     security purposes, so there is no way to disable it. The problem is; when
                                     trying to match IP addresses to host names, a DNS timeout can add up to
                                     several minutes to each invocation. If you do not have a DNS server to
                                     resolve the addresses to names, say on a private LAN for instance, it will be
                                     necessary to revert back to the <i>'old way'</i> of the pre-DNS internet,
                                     i.e. the hosts file.  This is a text file containing address/host name pairs,
                                     which the operating system will check first, before attempting a DNS lookup.<br><br>

                                     On *nix-type systems (Solaris/Linux/BSD/OSX...) the file is in: /etc/hosts
                                     &nbsp; <i>(ok, i know you guys knew that ;-)</i><br>
                                     On Windows systems, it is typically: \WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
                                     &nbsp; <i>(yet who knows where microsoft will move it next)</i><br><br>

                                     Here you would put the IP address/host name pairs for the machines that do
                                     not have DNS support.<br><br>

                                     <a id="2"></a><b><u>2. Network Realities:</u></b> While it is very simple to
                                     write code without regard to locality or remoteness of objects, it is very
                                     important to remember that any remote invocation can fail, or block for a
                                     very long time, if there is a problem with the network, or the target machine
                                     is unresponsive. The invoke interface is declared to throw an exception for
                                     two good reasons: One is logical, i.e. the invocation is invalid; the other
                                     is genuinely exceptional, i.e. something completely unexpected happened.<br><br>

                                     These realities can be managed in three different ways: First, when dealing
                                     with a remote item reference, your code should be prepared for unexpected
                                     network exceptions, and long transaction delays. Second, a proxy can be sent
                                     which manages these error conditions when calling its remote sender. (This
                                     makes life very nice for the user) Third, when it absolutely positively
                                     cannot go wrong, a proxy can be sent containing all of its necessary
                                     functionality, making little to no use of its remote link back to its
                                     sender.<br><br>

                                     signature, in the client interface, declare that it throws <tt>
                                     java.rmi.RemoteException</tt>. Whilst this is technically not <i>required;</i>
                                     The benefit is that it will <i>force</i> wrapping remote invocations in a
                                     try/catch block, to manage when remote method invocations go bad, for network
                                     related reasons.<br><br>

                                     Lastly, I find it extremely helpful to print, frame, memorize, and post
                                     somewhere near your monitor, the eight <a href=http://blogs.sun.com/jag/resource/Fallacies.html>

                                     <a id="3"></a><b><u>3. Firewalled Clients:</u></b> Very often a client item
                                     is operating behind a firewall that prohibits inbound socket connections. If
                                     server callbacks are necessary for the design, this posed a real problem. A
                                     solution to this issue is provided through two specialised classes in the
                                     gnu.cajo.utils.extra package. The <a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ClientProxy.html>
                                     ClientProxy</a> object is used to locally represent a callable reference to
                                     the client, item in the server address space. A server would instantiate a ClientProxy, and pass a remote
                                     reference to it to the client. The client would then combine that reference,
                                     with a reference to the local item in an <a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/ItemProxy.html>
                                     ItemProxy</a> object. This transparent approach allows object design for both
                                     servers and clients, without regard for the firewall issue. To see a simple
                                     example application, please visit our <a href=http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/FirewalledClients>

                                     <a id="4"></a><b><u>4. Marshalling Objects:</u></b> Sometimes, when sending
                                     large objects, particularly those which are a large graph of objects,
                                     exceptions can randomly occur during deserialisation. While this is not a
                                     defect in the framework, it can be very annoying. One particularly helpful
                                     technique is for the sender to encapsulate the object in a
                                     <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/MarshalledObject.html>java.rmi.MarshalledObject</a>.
                                     Then the receiver can retrieve the original object using its
                                     <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/MarshalledObject.html#get()>get()</a>
                                     method. Encapsulating objects this way seems to make them far less prone to
                                     failure during transmission. The reason why this failure occurs, and even why
                                     this technique helps to fix it, is still a mystery. (see also item 6 below)<br><br>

                                     <a id="5"></a><b><u>5. Sending Proxies:</u></b> Proxy objects, when sent
                                     from remote JVMs, typically arrive in a Marshalled Object. There is a
                                     <i>very</i> important reason for this. A proxy is an object whose codebase
                                     is typically foreign to its hosting VM. When a proxy is extracted from the
                                     MarshalledObject, via its <tt>get</tt> method, its remote codebase will
                                     be automatically loaded over the network, from the location information
                                     contained <i>within</i> the MarshalledObject. The proxy now exists, and can
                                     be used, but does not contain information about where its codebase came from.
                                     If you try to send the proxy object itself to another VM, the receiver will
                                     most likely suffer a <tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt>. However, putting the
                                     proxy in a MarshalledObject first, <i>will</i> work correctly.
                                     MarshalledObjects are very special containers, which record codebase
                                     annotation, with which proxy objects can be freely sent between remote
                                     JVMs.<br><br>

                                     configures the TCP settings for network communication. Specifying port
                                     1099, which is the <i>default</i> port for the Java RMIRegistry,
                                     eliminates the need to explicitly specify a port number, in a server lookup

                                     mechanism to provide a <i>useful-guess</i> at TCP configuration has now
                                     been added. If you do not explicitly configure Remote, it will now
                                     remote on an <i>anonymous</i> port. The actual port selected from the unused
                                     pool by the OS at runtime, can be determined by calling Remote.<a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html#getServerPort>getServerPort</a>.
                                     It is effectively an default call to Remote.<a href=nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html#config(java.lang.String,%20int,%20java.lang.String,%20int)>config(null, 0, null, 0)</a>.<br><br>

                                     <a href=servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=2539>official</a> port number 1198,
                                     it is <i>highly</i> recommended to use this port when configuring remote for

                                     <a id="7"></a><b><u>7. Excessive Decomposition:</u></b> The interfaces to
                                     remote objects should tend to favor functional richnes, over logical
                                     abstraction. Unlike an all-local object application; a remote procedure call
                                     is a temporally expensive activity. This <i>strongly</i> favors the creation
                                     of much <i>fewer</i> interface objects, with more functionally complete
                                     methods, to be used when remoting. In other words: <i>"Export trees,
                                     <u>not</u> leaves."</i></a><br><br>

                                     <a id="8"></a><b><u>8. Method Visibility:</u></b> When an object is made
                                     remotely accessible via <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a>,
                                     <i>all</i> of its public methods, <i>including</i> its static ones, can be
                                     invoked by a remote JVM. This would make remoting an object that extended
                                     Thread for instance, a questionable choice, as its <tt>run()</tt> method
                                     could be repeatedly invoked remotely. Unless all possible clients are known
                                     to be well behaved, an object should have <u><i>no</i></u> public methods it
                                     does <u><i>not</i></u> want a client to be able to call. This gotcha is the
                                     corollary to the <a href=faq.html#14>FAQ #14</a>.<br><br>


                                     <a id="9"></a><b><u>9. Reference Lifetime:</u></b> When remote references to
                                     objects are created, normally they last for the life of the server JVM.
                                     Typically, this is what one would expect, when creating service objects.
                                     However, there are times when the lifetime of a remote reference is
                                     <i>"too long."</i>
                                     <br><br>Typically one of two scenarios come into play:<ul>
                                     <li> All of the remoted objects need to be shut down, typically needed by
                                     application server containers. To accomodate this, the Remote.shutdown()
                                     method is provided, it terminates <i>all</i> outstanding remote references.
                                     It is also recommended if the server would like to exit normally, without
                                     having to call System.exit().<br><br>
                                     <li> Remote references to objects that are used by a client for a
                                     <i>short-term,</i> e.g. to
                                     monitor a transaction progress, whose lifetime is dictated by the clients,
                                     rather than the server. When remoting these objects, it is <u>essential</u>
                                     to use a special Remote method e.g.:<blockquote><tt>
                                        return new Remote(clientMonitor).clientScope();
                                     </tt></blockquote>This will prevent the <u><i>memory leak</i></u> that would
                                     occur, if remote references to short-term objects were returned. The
                                     method is named as such because, in this case, the lifetime of the remote
                                     reference is under the control of the clients, rather than the server. I.e.
                                     when the one (or more) clients no longer refer to the remote reference, it
                                     will then be disposed to the heapspace automatically. (Otherwise you would
                                     have to invoke Remote.unexport() on the reference manually)
