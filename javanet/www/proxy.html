                              <b>Proxy cajo items distribute server functionality to the client.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           If you haven't read the page on items yet, you really should first, since
                           a proxy is just another type of an <a href=item.html>Item</a>. Proxies can
                           be any object, though they generally derive from
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseProxy.html>BaseProxy</a>.
                           Proxies are sent to a client by, and on behalf of, a server item. BaseProxy
                           subclasses will arrive with a remote link back to its server item, on which
                           it can asynchronously communicate with it.  Proxies are often used to
                           pre-process method invocations made by the client, using the computing
                           resources of the client, rather than those of the server.

                           <h3>Base Proxies</h3><br>

                           A proxy can optionally provide a graphical user interface, if it is
                           intended to be more than just a machine-to-machine interface.
                           Architecturally a BaseProxy is very similar to a
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseItem.html>BaseItem</a>. It has a
                           <a href= docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseProxy.MainThread.html#BaseProxy.MainThread()>MainThread</a>,
                           which is cannonically launched by the client, on its arrival. It has a
                           final implementation of the <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Invoke.html>Invoke</a>
                           interface, used to route local and remote invocations to its public methods,
                           returning the results, if any. It also has a string table, which can be
                           automatically loaded with the language appropriate to the locale of the
                           client, if defined.<br><br>

                           Each proxy is served by, and services a specific server item. A server item
                           binds itself and serves its proxy object using the static
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ItemServer.html#bind(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object)>
                           bind</a> method of the <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ItemServer.html>ItemServer</a>
                           class .  It is generally necessary to start up a
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a>, on which
                           the  client will automatically request, and receive the proxy class files.
                           When a VM serves proxies, it will require two TCP ports; one for
                           communication with the server item itself, and another for sending the proxy
                           codebase via the CodebaseServer.  If a server does not use proxies, it only
                           needs one port. The CodebaseServer can also be used to send complex objects
                           to an client, who would in turn require the necessary class definitions.

                           <h3>Requesting Proxies</h3><br>

                           A proxy is typically obtained from an item reference by using a null argument
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/BaseItem.html#getProxy()>getProxy</a> invocation.
                           The returned item will be its default proxy, if it supports one. Once a proxy
                           item is received, the otrhodox initialization procedure is to:

                           <pre>   proxy.invoke("init", new Remote(proxy));</pre>

                           This will cause the proxy to load its string table, create its main thread,
                           and begin operating.  It can use the provided remote reference to itself,
                           to pass back to its server item, or to other remote items, on which they
                           may asynchronously communicate with it. The return of this invocation, if
                           non-null, will be the proxy's default graphical user interface.  The client
                           can display this if it wishes. The framework specifies only the method to
                           obtain the default proxy. If an item serves multiple proxies, the method or
                           methods to obtain them are application specific.  A <i>suggestion</i> would
                           be to use a string argument in a getProxy invocation, to specify the desired
                           proxy.

                           <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>

                           One of the most important features of a proxy is to mitigate network latency.
                           This can be of critical importance, if the remote item is very far away, or
                           linked over a slow network. Generally it is a recommended practice for
                           remote items to support a proxy. At a minimum, it would serve to minimize
                           network traffic, and pre-fetch objects contextually.  Effectively this type
                           of proxy would be considered a <i>'smart'</i> remote reference. Clients
                           would then have the option to use the proxy, or to manipulate the remote
                           object directly over the network.<br><br>

                           Both the proxy, and its serving item, can in turn give their remote
                           references to other items.  As a result, an item calling another item does not
                           know, or need even care, if it is invoking a local item, a remote item, a
                           local proxy, or a remote proxy.<br><br>

                           The next section <a href=multicast.html>multicast</a> will show how items
                           can send, or receive, remote item references using a method analogous to a
                           radio broadcast.<br<br>
