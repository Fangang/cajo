                              <b>Proxy items distribute server functionality to the client.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           If you haven't  read the page on items yet, you really should first, since
                           a proxy is just another type of an <a href=item.html>item</a>.  A proxy is
                           an item, sent to a hosting VM to execute in its runtime. It is sent by an
                           Item, and arrives with a link to the item's remote interface, on which it
                           can invoke its methods.  Its purpose is to pre-process invocations made
                           by the client, except using the computing resources of the client, as
                           opposed to those of the server.<br><br>

                           A proxy can optionally have a graphical user interface, if it is
                           intended as more than just a machine-to-machine interface. Architecturally
                           a BaseProxy is very similar to a BaseItem, it has a thread, which is
                           cannonically launched by the client, upon its arrival. It also has a final
                           implementation of the invoke interface, which is used to route remote
                           invocations, to the applicable public method, returning the result, if any.
                           It has a few differences from a BaseItem however. It has a string table,
                           which can be loaded with the language appropriate to the locale of the
                           hosting VM. (if provided) It also has a link back to its remote server,
                           as mentioned above.<br><br>

                           Each proxy is served by, and services an Item. An item binds itself and
                           provides its proxy interface using the static
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ProxyServer.html>gnu.cajo.utils.ProxyServer.bind</a>
                           method.  This also starts up the proxy codebase server, on which the client
                           will request, and receive, the proxy class files.  If a VM serves proxies,
                           it will require two TCP ports; one for communication with the server item,
                           and another for sending the proxy codebase.  If a server does not use
                           proxies, it only needs one port.<br><br>

                           A server item can also accept proxies from other items, this is done when
                           invoking the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ItemServer.html>gnu.cajo.utils.ItemServer.bind</a>
                           or the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/ProxyServer.html>gnu.cajo.utils.ProxyServer.bind</a>
                           methods. There is a boolean argument <b><code>acceptProxies</code></b>
                           for this purpose.  Unless it is set, the item will not accept the proxy.
                           A proxy can be sent to an item, using the <b><code>setProxy</code></b>
                           invocation with the proxy object as the argument.  This call will result
                           in a <b><code>ClassNotFoundException</code></b>, if the called item does
                           not accept proxies.  If the invocation is successful, the returned value
                           from the invocation will be a remote reference to the installed proxy,
                           over which the sending item can communicate with it.<br><br>

                           A proxy can be obtained from an item reference by using a null argument
                           <b><code>getProxy</code></b> invocation. The returned item, if non-null,
                           will be its default proxy.  Once a proxy item is received, the required
                           installation procedure is to:

                           <pre><b><code>   proxy.invoke("init", new Remote(proxy));</code></b></pre>

                           This will cause the proxy to load its string table, create its main thread,
                           and begin operating.  It can use the provided remote reference to itself,
                           to pass back to its calling server, or to other remote items, on which they
                           may asynchronously communicate with the proxy as necessary. The framework
                           specifies only the method to obtain the default proxy. If an item serves
                           multiple proxies, the method(s) to obtain them is application specific.  A
                           recommendation would be to use a string argument in a <b><code>
                           getProxy</code></b> invocation, to specify the desired proxy.<br><br>

                           Both the proxy, and its serving item, can in turn give their remote
                           references to other items.  Thererby, an item calling another item does not
                           know, or even care, if it is invoking on a local item, a remote item, a
                           local proxy, or a remote proxy.<br><br>

                           The framework can allow an application, i.e. a collection of objects, to
                           start on a single machine, and scale until each of its items are not only on
                           separate virtual machines, but even separate <i>physical</i> machines!  This
                           creates the potential for using the network as one giant computer, or a
                           giant supercomputing cluster; depending on your point of view.  The machines
                           can be PCs, Macs, Workstations... everything from Mainframes, to Mobile
                           Phones. This architecture is compatible with all Java platforms; J2ME / J2SE
                           / J2EE<br><br>

                           The next section <a href=multicast.html>multicast</a> will show how items
                           can send, or receive, their own and other remote references, using a method
                           similar to a radio broadcast.<br<br>
