                           disproportionately often.  These deserve their own space, as they have the
                           highest statistical probability of being very helpful.<br>

                           <a id="1"></a><b><u>1. Why doesn't the example work in Appletviewer?</u></b>
                           The <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a> tells
                           the browser to make the applet 100% of the width and height of its window.
                           While this has been legal HTML since 1.0, the Appletviewer doesn't know what
                           to make of it, as it has no window open when it connects to the server. If
                           you <i>really</i> need to use Appletviewer, you'll have to edit
                           CodebaseServer to use a fixed width and height value.  Then you will be
                           able to use the tool.<br><br>

                           <a id="2"></a><b><u>2. What if someone forks this code?</u></b> A fork, i.e.
                           an alternative development, is something I would not like to see happen, as
                           it could divide the community. I am completely open to new ideas, and I could
                           not envision any useful reason to do it. Most importantly, the gnu.cajo
                           packages belong to this project, and for cajo objects to link, they must use
                           these packages specifically. Besides, in this type of project, there is so
                           much greater capability gained through cooperation.<br><br>

                           <a id="3"></a><b><u>3. What is a zedmob?</u></b> A zedmob first off, is a
                           contraction of the two words <i><u>Z</u></i>ipp<i><u>ed</u></i>
                           <i><u>M</u></i>arshalled<i><u>Ob</u></i>ject. It is the standard mechanism for
                           encapsulating remote item references, serialized objects, and item proxies;
                           for transmission over the network, or storage on disc. A zedmob is
                           particularly helpful in the case of proxies, as items are free to pass a
                           proxy zedmob between each other, and successfully extract the proxy. This is
                           because its codebase annotation stays intact. In other words; once a proxy is
                           extracted from a zedmob, it cannot be passed to another item, <i>unless</i>
                           that item <i>already</i> has the codebase for the proxy, since the codebase
                           location information is lost. A zedmob is typically written to a stream, and
                           read from a stream, using the static zedmob methods of the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a> class, and typically
                           has the file extension .zmob for identification.<br><br>

                           <a id="4"></a><b><u>4. Can I forcibly disconnect a client?</u></b> The answer is
                           yes, but, it will take a little effort. In RMI it is possible to terminate an
                           object's remoteness, but it will mean for <u>all</u> remote VMs connected to
                           it. If you want to disconnect a <i>specific</i> client, you need to uniquely
                           remote the object reference given to that client using the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a> class. Then you can
                           invoke the remote wrapper's <tt>unexportObject()</tt> method, inherited from
                           java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject. This can be used to forcibly terminate
                           all remote connections to that wrapper, and even to check if any remote
                           invocations were in progress (or pending) on it.<br><br>

                           <a id="5"></a><b><u>5. Can I restrict my server only to local clients?</u></b>
                           This is an intriguing question; fortunately the answer is <u>yes</u>! To make
                           the <a href=tutorial.html#launching>example</a> server solely accessible
                           locally, use the following startup:<br><br>

                           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar server.jar 1111 2222 localhost localhost<br><br>

                           The two port numbers, for http and rmiregistry service respectively, can be
                           anything, even zero, meaning chosen randomly at runtime. What the localhost
                           arguments will do is require the <a href=tutorial.html#connecting>client</a>
                           to connect specifically to the host name <i>localhost</i>, or to
                           <i>127.0.0.1</i>. This effectively restricts access to this server only to
                           clients running locally on the machine. For example:<br><br>

                           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar client.jar <u>//localhost:2222/</u>
                           &nbsp <i>-or-</i> &nbsp <u>//127.0.0.1:2222/</u><br><br>

                           <a id="6"></a><b><u>6. What is this crazy cajo coding style?</u></b> I never
                           thought this would become a FAQ, but apparently it has. OK, over the years
                           I've become quite tolerant of allowing each developer his own formatting
                           style. <i>(I know this freedom drives some developers crazy!)</i> Basically,
                           I find it becomes easy to <u><i>see</i></u> who wrote a section; just by its
                           formatting. In my case, my primary motivation is: <i>I hate <u>whitespace</u>!</i>
                           Other developers seem to love the stuff. I think this stems from my early
                           years, developing large applications in assembly language. There each line
                           did so little, that to get an overview of how a subroutine <i>(prehistoric
                           for method)</i> worked, you needed to see a <u>lot</u> of lines. In Computer
                           Science there is a concept called <i>Locality of Reference</i>. Basically it means
                           how much adjacent code is involved in any particular operation. I believe as
                           developers improve, their locality of reference increases. I hear both noobs,
                           and <i>so-called</i> industry experts, proclaim that no method should be
                           longer than 9 to 12 lines: <u>rubbish</u>! Were that reasonable, no books
                           should be written above the Grade 5 reading level. As you probably know, I
                           have methods of 100 lines or more; but precisely as many as needed, no less
                           and <u>definitely</u> no more! Even when I print, it is always 4 pages per
                           sheet, ordered top to bottom. I do however heartily recommend, and try to
                           closely follow, Sun Microsystems' code
                           <a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html>conventions</a>
                           for the Java programming language.<br><br>

                           <a id="7"></a><b><u>7. Can I run cajo over Secure Sockets Layer?</u></b>
                           Well, yes this should be possible. Uh, these days however, living in the uh,
                           land of the <i>'free'</i>, it could be really dangerous to give out
                           information on strong cryptography that can be directly traced back to me.
                           <i>(I don't want to be exiled to Cuba)</i> I suppose however, it couldn't
                           hurt to link to someone else's fine work. So, let's just say, hypothetically
                           speaking, if you went <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/samples/index.html target=_blank>here</a>,
                           and copied the sample <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/samples/jssesamples.zip>zip file</a>,
                           and replaced the two socket factories in <tt>gnu.cajo.invoke.Remote</tt>,
                           that just might get the system communicating over SSL. Of course I must not
                           endorse any of this... <i>(cough* Patriot Act *cough). &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Psst:
                           if you want something even <u>stronger</u>, take a look
                           <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/files/documents/974/6293/CryptObject.java>here</a>.

                           <a id="8"></a><b><u>8. Why is there no package version number?</u></b>
                           This is an <u>excellent</u> question! In the cajo project, a release
                           version number is irrelevant. This is due to the philosophy of its design.
                           This project evolves continuously, but always in a consistently backward
                           compatible manner. Why? Because it is important to remember that in this
                           framework, one will both receive, and use, objects at varying levels of
                           development in the project's timeline. This is not unlike natural language;
                           for example, one does not ask: "Might we converse, at v.1.2.7.a," rather, one
                           interacts, at the highest common ground possible. This project is
                           fundamentally focused on communication, between virtual machines, potentially
                           separated in <u>both</u> space <b>and</b> time... <i>Woah dude</i>, What hast
                           thou spoketh?<br><br>
