                                      <a id="1"></a><b><u>1. Why doesn't the example work in Appletviewer?</u></b>
                                      The <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a> tells
                                      the browser to make the applet 100% of the width and height of its window.
                                      While this has been legal HTML since 1.0, the Appletviewer doesn't know what
                                      to make of it, as it has no window open when it connects to the server. If
                                      you <i>really</i> need to use Appletviewer, you'll have to edit
                                      CodebaseServer to use a fixed width and height value.<br><br>

                                      <a id="2"></a><b><u>2. What if someone forks this code?</u></b> A fork; i.e.
                                      an alternative development, is something I would not like to see happen, as
                                      it could divide the community. Besides, in this type of project, there is
                                      <i>much</i> more to be gained through cooperation. However, it is an
                                      essential freedom; to forever prevent technological lock-in.<br><br>

                                      <a id="3"></a><b><u>3. What is a zedmob?</u></b> A zedmob first off, is a
                                      contraction of the two words <i><u>Z</u></i>ipp<i><u>ed</u></i>
                                      <i><u>M</u></i>arshalled<i><u>Ob</u></i>ject. It is the standard mechanism for
                                      encapsulating remote item references, serialized objects, and item proxies;
                                      for transmission over the network, or storage on disc. A zedmob is
                                      particularly helpful in the case of proxies, as items are free to pass a
                                      proxy zedmob between each other, and successfully extract the proxy. This is
                                      because its codebase annotation stays intact. In other words; once a proxy is
                                      extracted from a zedmob, it cannot be passed to another item, <i>unless</i>
                                      that item <i>already</i> has the codebase for the proxy; since the codebase
                                      location information is lost. A zedmob is typically written to a stream, and
                                      read from a stream, using the static <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html#zedmob(java.io.InputStream)>
                                      zedmob</a> methods of the Remote class, and typically has the file extension
                                      .zmob for identification.<br><br>

                                      <a id="4"></a><b><u>4. Can I forcibly disconnect a client?</u></b> The answer is
                                      yes, but it will take a little effort. In RMI it is possible to terminate an
                                      object's remoteness, but it will mean for <u>all</u> remote VMs connected to
                                      it. If you want to disconnect a <i>specific</i> client, you need to uniquely
                                      remote the object reference given to that client using the
                                      <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a> class. Then you can
                                      invoke the remote wrapper's <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/server/UnicastRemoteObject.html#unexportObject(java.rmi.Remote,%20boolean)>
                                      unexportObject()</a> method, which it inherits from UnicastRemoteObject. This
                                      can be used to forcibly terminate all remote connections to that wrapper, and
                                      even to check if any remote invocations were in progress (or pending) on it.<br><br>

                                      <a id="5"></a><b><u>5. Can I restrict my server only to local clients?</u></b>
                                      This is an intriguing question; fortunately the answer is <u>yes</u>! To make
                                      the <a href=tutorial.html#launching>example</a> server solely accessible
                                      locally, use the following startup:<br><br>

                                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar server.jar 1111 2222 localhost localhost<br><br>

                                      The two port numbers, for http and rmiregistry service respectively, can be
                                      anything, even zero, meaning chosen at runtime. What the localhost arguments
                                      will do is require the <a href=tutorial.html#connecting>client</a> to connect
                                      specifically to the host name <i>localhost</i>, or to <i>127.0.0.1</i>. This
                                      effectively restricts access to this server only to clients running locally
                                      on the machine. For example:<br><br>

                                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar client.jar <u>//localhost:2222/</u>
                                      &nbsp <i>-or-</i> &nbsp <u>//127.0.0.1:2222/</u><br><br>

                                      <a id="6"></a><b><u>6. What is this crazy cajo coding style?</u></b> I never
                                      thought this would become a FAQ, but apparently it has. OK, over the years
                                      I've become quite tolerant of allowing each developer his own formatting
                                      style. <i>(I know this freedom drives some developers crazy!)</i> Basically,
                                      I find it becomes easy to <i>see</i> who wrote a section; just by its
                                      formatting. In my case, my primary motivation is: <i>I hate <u>whitespace</u>!</i>
                                      Other developers seem to love the stuff. I think this stems from my early
                                      years, developing large applications in assembly language. There each line
                                      did so little, that to get an overview of how a subroutine <i>(prehistoric
                                      for method)</i> worked, you needed to see a <u>lot</u> of lines. In Computer
                                      Science there is a concept called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference>
                                      Locality of Reference</a>. Basically it means how many adjacent resources are
                                      involved in any particular operation. I believe as developers improve, their
                                      locality of reference increases. I hear both noobs, and <i>so-called</i>
                                      industry experts, proclaim that no method should be longer than 9 to 12
                                      lines: <u>rubbish</u>! Were that reasonable, no books should be written above
                                      the Grade 5 reading level. As you probably know, I have methods of 100 lines
                                      or more; but precisely as many as needed, no less, and <u>definitely</u> no
                                      more! Even when I print code, it is always 4 pages per sheet, ordered top to
                                      bottom. I do however heartily recommend, and try to follow, Sun Microsystems'
                                      code <a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/>conventions</a> for the Java
                                      programming language.<br><br>

                                      <a id="7"></a><b><u>7. Can I run cajo over Secure Sockets Layer?</u></b>
                                      Why, yes, this should be possible... Uh, these days however, living in the uh,
                                      land of the <i>'free'</i>; it could be really dangerous to give out
                                      information on strong cryptography that can be directly traced back to me.
                                      <i>(I don't want to be exiled to Cuba;)</i> I suppose however, it couldn't

                                      This is an <u>excellent</u> question! In the cajo project, a release
                                      version number is irrelevant. This is due to the philosophy of its design.
                                      This project evolves continuously, but always in a consistently <i>forward</i>
                                      compatible manner. Why? Because it is important to remember that in this
                                      framework, one will both receive, and use, objects at varying levels of
                                      development in the project's timeline. This is not unlike natural language;
                                      for example, one does not ask: "Might we converse, at v.1.2.7.a," rather, one
                                      interacts, at the highest common ground possible. This project is
                                      fundamentally focused on communication, between virtual machines, potentially
                                      separated in <i>both</i> space <u>and</u> time... <i>Woah dude</i>; What hast

                                      <a id="9"></a><b><u>9. Can my application put proxies in an Applet sandbox?</u></b>
                                      Wow, what an important question! I am sorry the answer to this was not
                                      perfectly clear sooner: Of course, it is Yes! This is easily done. When
                                      starting up your application, use the following two -D arugments:
                                      <blockquote><tt>
                                         java -jar -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=policyURL myApp.jar
                                      </tt></blockquote>
                                      The first -D argument puts the entire VM in an applet sandbox. Then, if you
                                      need <i>your</i> host code to be free of these restrictions, the second
                                      -D argument is used. It specifies a policy file, which could look
                                      something like this:
                                      <blockquote><tt>
                                         grant codeBase "file:${java.class.path}" {<br>
                                         &nbsp&nbsp  permission java.security.AllPermission;<br>

                                      </tt></blockquote>
                                      This file gives full permissions, but <i>only</i> to classes that were loaded
                                      from <u>your</u> local filesystem.<br><br>

                                      fair question. I guess the best answer is; it had to be named <i>something</i>.
                                      It also seemed like; <i>all the good names were taken!</i> I certainly didn't

                                      dispute. Instead I opted for a risky personal association. I believed
                                      in this framework <u><i>so</i></u> strongly: I gave it my first, and only
                                      <i>'net</i> handle; dating back to 1979. I essentially put my entire online
                                      reputation at stake. The name was christened by my high school sysadmin, as
                                      a username on an old <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System/360>
                                      System/360</a>. He took the first two letters of a <i>'computer club'</i>
                                      member's last name, and concatenated it with the first two of the first. I
                                      then went on to use it at University, and ever since. I hope he never found
                                      out the full extent; but he was the first person to let me <i>really</i>

                                      not layout in a <u>single</u> panel. For the past 5 years or so, it has been

                                      <i>secret</i>; it is extremely fast, and flexible, and with its component
                                      overlaying capability, it is unmached by any of the standard layout managers.

                                      To provide the <i>ultimate</i> in flexibility, the answer is: <u><i>Either</u>!</i>
                                      The Java language <i>only</i> allows passing objects by reference; meaning
                                      that when you provide an object to a method as an argument, any changes the
                                      method makes to that object are actually changes to <i>your</i> object. In
                                      cajo an object is passed by reference to a remote Virtual Machine, by
                                      wrapping it in a <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>
                                      Remote</a> object. However unlike Java, and  more like C++, cajo <i>also</i>
                                      allows you to pass an object by value; meaning the receiving method gets an
                                      exact <i>copy</i> of the object, and anything it does to it, has <i>no</i>
                                      affect on your object. This is accomplished very simply, by passing the
                                      object <u><i>without</i></u> wrapping it in a Remote wrapper. (<i><u>Note</u>:</i>
                                      If the client receiving this object does not have the class file for this
                                      object, then you will need to run something like a <a href=server.html>
                                      CodebaseServer</a> to provide it.)<br><br>

                                      By using the lowest practical target JRE, the cajo project ensures
                                      compatibility with all <i>higher</i> versions. Note that this in no way
                                      <i>restricts</i> application code from targeting whatever JRE target is
                                      needed. In general, the lower the JRE version a Java application can
                                      successfuly target; the more JREs, and subsequently larger installed base,
                                      on which it can run.<br><br>

                                      <a id="14"></a><b><u>14. Can my item have public methods that are only locally invokable?</u></b>
                                      Yes. This brings up a very important feature in the design of of cajo
                                      transparent remote invocation. If an object implements the gnu.cajo.invoke.Invoke
                                      interface, any invocation through Remote.invoke will automatically be passed
                                      to its interface, rather than being performed on its public methods directly.
                                      This feature makes things like <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/MonitorItem.html>
                                      MonitorItem</a> and <a href=https://cajo.dev.java.net/docs/gnu/cajo/utils/extra/AuditorItem.html>
                                      AuditorItem</a> possible. It can also allow your item to have public methods
                                      which can be invoked only by objects within the same Virtual Machine. You
                                      would simply implement Invoke, and manually route calls only to those methods
                                      you wish to make remotely callable. Normally this can <i>(and should)</i> be
                                      avoided completely, by designing an object expressly for remote invocation
                                      from the outset. However this is sometimes helpful, when remoting a derived
                                      object, one that implements java.lang.Runnable for example.<br><br>

                                      While it would perhaps be conceptually simpler to run a central rmiregistry
                                      in its own JVM; this would represent a very unsatisfactory single point of
                                      failure, for the entire server physical machine. The additional load of
                                      carrying an individual rmiregistry within each server JVM is very small, but
                                      the added stability it buys is very large.
