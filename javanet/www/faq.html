                              <b>Frequently Asked Questions.</b><br><br>
                           </font>

                           This page will stand as a living document, based on the feedback of
                           developers.  In any project, a certain collection of questions are asked
                           disproportionately often.  These deserve their own space, as they have the
                           highest statistical probability of being very helpful.<br><br>

                           <b><u>Why doesn't the example work in Appletviewer?</u></b> The
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a> tells the
                           browser to make the applet 100% of the width and height of its window.  While
                           this has been legal HTML since 1.0, the Appletviewer doesn't know what to make
                           of it, as it has no window open when it connects to the server.
                           If you <i>really</i> need to use Appletviewer, you'll have to edit
                           CodebaseServer to use a fixed width and height value.  Then you will be
                           able to use the tool.<br><br>

                           <b><u>What if someone forks this code?</u></b> A fork, i.e. an alternative
                           development, is something I would not like to see happen, as it could divide
                           the community. I am completely open to new ideas, and I could not envision
                           any useful reason to do it. Most importantly, the gnu.cajo packages belong to
                           this project, and for cajo objects to link, they must use these packages
                           specifically. Besides, in this type of project, there is so much greater
                           capability gained through cooperation.<br><br>

                           <b><u>What is a zedmob?</u></b> A zedmob first off is a contraction of the
                           words <b><u>Z</u></b>ipp<b><u>ed</u></b> <b><u>M</u></b>arshalled<b><u>Ob</u></b>ject.
                           It is the standard method for encapsulating remote references, objects, and
                           proxies, for transmission over the network, or storage on disc. A zedmob is
                           particularly helpful in the case of proxies, as items can pass a proxy zedmob
                           between each other and successfully extract the proxy. This is because its
                           codebase annotation stays intact. In other words, once a proxy is extracted
                           from a zedmob, it can not be passed to another item, unless that item already
                           has the codebase for the proxy, as the codebase location information is lost.
                           A zedmob is typically written to a stream, and read from a stream using the
                           static zedmob methods of the Remote class.
