                           This page will stand as a living document, based on the feedback of
                           developers.  In any project, a certain collection of questions are asked
                           disproportionately often.  These deserve their own space, as they have the
                           highest statistical probability of being very helpful.<br>

                           <a id="1"></a><b><u>1. Why doesn't the example work in Appletviewer?</u></b>
                           The <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/CodebaseServer.html>CodebaseServer</a> tells
                           the browser to make the applet 100% of the width and height of its window.
                           While this has been legal HTML since 1.0, the Appletviewer doesn't know what
                           to make of it, as it has no window open when it connects to the server. If
                           you <i>really</i> need to use Appletviewer, you'll have to edit
                           CodebaseServer to use a fixed width and height value.  Then you will be
                           able to use the tool.<br><br>

                           <a id="2"></a><b><u>2. What if someone forks this code?</u></b> A fork, i.e.
                           an alternative development, is something I would not like to see happen, as
                           it could divide the community. I am completely open to new ideas, and I could
                           not envision any useful reason to do it. Most importantly, the gnu.cajo
                           packages belong to this project, and for cajo objects to link, they must use
                           these packages specifically. Besides, in this type of project, there is so
                           much greater capability gained through cooperation.<br><br>

                           <a id="3"></a><b><u>3. What is a zedmob?</u></b> A zedmob first off, is a
                           contraction of the two words <i><u>Z</u></i>ipp<i><u>ed</u></i>
                           <i><u>M</u></i>arshalled<i><u>Ob</u></i>ject. It is the standard mechanism for
                           encapsulating remote item references, serialized objects, and item proxies;
                           for transmission over the network, or storage on disc. A zedmob is
                           particularly helpful in the case of proxies, as items are free to pass a
                           proxy zedmob between each other, and successfully extract the proxy. This is
                           because its codebase annotation stays intact. In other words; once a proxy is
                           extracted from a zedmob, it cannot be passed to another item, <i>unless</i>
                           that item <i>already</i> has the codebase for the proxy, since the codebase
                           location information is lost. A zedmob is typically written to a stream, and
                           read from a stream, using the static zedmob methods of the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a> class.<br><br>

                           <a id="4"></a><b><u>4. Can I forcibly disconnect a client?</u></b> The answer is
                           yes, but, it will take a little effort. In RMI it is possible to terminate an
                           object's remoteness, but it will mean for <u>all</u> remote VMs connected to
                           it. If you want to disconnect a <i>specific</i> client, you need to uniquely
                           remote the object reference given to that client using the
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/invoke/Remote.html>Remote</a> class. Then you can
                           invoke the remote wrapper's <tt>unexportObject()</tt> method, inherited from
                           java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject. This can be used to forcibly terminate
                           all remote connections to that wrapper, and even to check if any remote
                           invocations were in progress (or pending) on it.<br><br>

                           <a id="5"></a><b><u>5. Can I restrict my server only to local clients?</u></b>
                           This is an intiguing question; fortunately the answer is <u>yes</u>! To make
                           the <a href=tutorial.html#launching>example</a> server solely accessible
                           locally, use the following startup:<br><br>

                           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar server.jar 1111 2222 localhost localhost<br><br>

                           The two port numbers, for http and rmiregistry service respectively, can be
                           anything, even zero, meaning chosen randomly at runtime. What the localhost
                           arguments will do is require the <a href=tutorial.html#connecting>client</a>
                           to connect specifically to the host name <i>localhost</i>, or to
                           <i>127.0.0.1</i>. This effectively restricts access to this server only to
                           clients running locally on the machine. For example:<br><br>

                           &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp java -jar client.jar <u>//localhost:2222/</u>
                           &nbsp <i>-or-</i> &nbsp <u>//127.0.0.1:2222/</u><br><br>
