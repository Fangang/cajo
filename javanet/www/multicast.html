                              <b>Connecting to cajo objects independently of their server's host address.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           The <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>Multicast</a> class performs
                           two complimentary functions. First, it allows an object to <i>"broadcast"</i>
                           a remote reference to itself over the network. Second, it allows an object to
                           listen for, and <i>catch</i>, these reference broadcasts. Once caught, an
                           object can invoke the public methods of the broadcasting object. These two
                           functions operate entirely independently of each other; i.e. an object can
                           broadcast without listening, and listen without broadcasting, it can even
                           do both.  If it is listening when it broadcasts, a VM will even catch its
                           own reference.

                           <h3>Using Multicast</h3><br>

                           The use of multicasting is completely application specific; for example, it
                           can be used to join a group of inter-operating objects, or it can be used to
                           announce a particular event.  Essentially, it gives objects an opportunity to
                           connect to each other spontaneously, without having to know the host address'
                           of the listening or sending items beforehand. This is particularly useful in
                           DHCP environments, where each machine's host address can be randomly assigned
                           and reassigned.<br><br>

                           There are two parameters on which the objects must agree in order to send
                           and receive references between each other.  An IP address, and port number,
                           define a specific <i>"channel"</i>, to use a radio analogy. Changing either
                           of these values effectively switches to an entirely different channel.  This
                           UDP/IP address/port pair is fundamentally different from a TCP/IP address in
                           that it doesn't identify a <i>specific</i> machine and socket, rather it
                           represents all machines that are a members of a <i>"group"</i>.<br><br>

                           A object can listen and broadcast on as many channels as it wants.
                           Applications can range from performing all multicasts on a single channel,
                           to using separate channels for each specific meaning. A server performs a
                           broadcast by passing a reference to any object to a multicast object's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#announce(java.lang.Object,%20int)>
                           announce</a> method.<br><br>

                           The framework defines a default channel, which can be useful for spontaneous
                           inter-networking.  To use a <b><i>Star Trek</i></b> metaphor; it could be
                           likened to the <i>'hailing frequency'</i>, for contacting new and unknown
                           objects. Extracting interface information from spontaneously discovered
                           objects is currently application specific, unless there is strong community
                           interest for its standardization. The official <i>suggestion</i> would be
                           for objects to implement a <code>String getDescription()</code> method, which
                           would return a description of the features and use of the object in detail,
                           with HTML markup allowed. Ideally, objects should also implement the
                           <code>getProxy()</code> method, to provide a local interface, which would in
                           turn provide a graphical user interface to the object, as described in the
                           <a href=proxy.html>proxy</a> tutorial, and demonstrated in the
                           <a href=example.html>example</a>. When an object announces its reference
                           on the hailing frequency, the <i>suggestion</i> would be for remote VMs to
                           invoke a method called <code>contact</code> on the received reference,
                           passing a string of the URL, typically in the form //host[:port]/[name], on
                           which its main object can be statically contacted, as the sole argument.

                           <h3>Receiving Multicasts</h3><br>

                           An object can register itself with a multicast object to listen for these
                           reference broadcasts.  It does this by invoking the multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#listen(java.lang.Object)>
                           listen</a> method, passing in a reference to itself.  When the multicast
                           object receives a broadcast of a remote object reference, it will invoke the
                           listener's public multicast method, passing a reference to itself, as
                           an argument. Logically, a listening object must implement the following
                           method:

                           <pre>   public Object multicast(Multicast m);</pre>

                           A multicast object has four public members, which can be accessed by the
                           listening object:<br><br>

                           <table>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>item</b></td>
                                 <td>The remote reference to the broadcasted object.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>iaddr</b></td>
                                 <td>The TCP address of the broadcasting server.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>address</b></td>
                                 <td>The UDP address on which this reference was received.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>port</b></td>
                                 <td>The UDP port on which this reference was received.</td>
                              </tr>
                           </table><br>

                           The reason for calling a listener with a reference to the multicast
                           object is to allow for the possibility of a single object to listen with
                           multiple multicast objects.  If the listener is listening with only one
                           Multicast object, there is no chance of its multicast method being invoked
                           reentrantly. However, if it is listening on more than one, the possibility
                           exists for reentrant invocation.<br><br>

                           A multicast object checks the return value of its listener's
                           multicast method invocation.  If it returns null, it will continue
                           listening; if the listener returns a non-null value, it will stop
                           listening.  To start the object listening again, its listen method must
                           be called, with either the same, or a different listener.

                           <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>

                           Graphically, the multicast concept looks something like this:<br><br>

                           <center><img src=images/multicast.gif></center><br><br>

                           Just as an <i>orthodox</i> item would support both the <code>getDescription</code>
                           and <code>getProxy</code> methods; an <i>orthodox</i> server would also be
                           listening on the hailing frequency, and giving its primary contact URL to
                           announcing items.<br><br>

                           The multicast mechanism creates the possibility for objects to spontaneously,
                           and dynamically connect. This allows objects to join confederations of
                           objects to accomplish larger tasks. Dynamic confederation can provide
                           resilient, adaptive, and fault-tolerant application networks, exhibiting
