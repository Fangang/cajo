                              <b>Connecting to items independently of their IP address.</b>
                           </font><br><br>

                           The
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>Multicast</a> class performs
                           two complimentary functions. First, it allows an item to <i>"broadcast"</i>
                           a remote reference to itself over the network. Second, it allows items to
                           listen for, and capture, these reference broadcasts. Once captured, an item
                           can communicate the broadcasting item. These two functions operate entirely
                           independently of each other; meaning an item can broadcast without
                           listening; and listen without broadcasting; it can even do both.  If it is
                           listening when it broadcasts, it will even capture its own reference.<br><br>

                           The use of multicasting is application specific; it can be used to join a
                           group of inter-operating items, or it can be used to announce a particular
                           event.  Essentially, it gives items an opportunity to connect to each other
                           spontaneously, without having to know the IP address' of the listening items
                           beforehand. This is particularly handy in DCHP environments, where each
                           machine's IP address is randomly assigned, and reassigned.<br><br>

                           <i>Note:</i> for long-range multicasting to work, the network routers must
                           be configured to pass UDP multicast packets.  If they are not, the
                           multicasting will work only within the subnet of origination.  There are
                           two parameters on which the items must agree in order to send and receive
                           references between each other.  An IP address and port number define a
                           specific <i>"channel"</i>, using the radio analogy. Changing either of
                           these, effectively switches to an entirely different channel.  The UDP/IP
                           address is different from a traditional TCP/IP address in that it doesn't
                           identify a machine (and socket) rather it represents all machines that are
                           a member of a <i>"group"</i>.<br><br>

                           A single item can listen and broadcast on as many channels as it wants.
                           Applications can range from performing all multicasts on a single
                           channel, to using separate channels for each specific meaning.  The
                           framework defines a default channel, which can be useful for spontaneous
                           inter-networking.  To use a <b><i>Star Trek</i></b> metaphor; it
                           could be likened to the <i>'hailing frequency'</i> for contacting new and
                           unknown items.  An item performs a broadcast by passing a remoted reference
                           to itself, or even some other item, to the multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#announce(gnu.cajo.invoke.Remote,%20int)>
                           announce</a> method.<br><br>

                           An item can register itself with a multicast object to listen for these
                           reference broadcasts.  It does this by invoking the multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#listen(gnu.cajo.invoke.Invoke)>
                           listen</a> method, passing in a reference to itself.  When the multicast
                           object receives a broadcast of a remote item reference, it will invoke the
                           listener with a string of <i>"multicast"</i>, and a reference to itself, as
                           an argument. Logically, a listening object must implement the following
                           method:
                           <b><pre>   public Object multicast(Multicast m);</pre></b>

                           A multicast object has four public members:<ul>
                              <li><code>iaddr   </code> The IP address of the broadcasting item.
                              <li><code>item    </code> The remote reference to the broadcasting item.
                              <li><code>address </code> The address on which this reference was received.
                              <li><code>port    </code> The port on which this reference was received.
                           </ul>The reason for calling a listener with a reference to the multicast
                           object is to allow for the possibility of a single item to listen, with
                           multiple multicast objects.  If the listener is listening with only one
                           object, there is no chance of its multicast method being invoked reentrantly.
                           However, if a listener is listening on more than one, the possibility
                           exists for reentrant invocation.<br><br>

                           A listening multicast object checks the return value of its listener's
                           invocation.  If it returns null, it will continue listening; if the method
                           returns a non-null value, it will stop listening.  To start the object
                           listening again, its listen method must be called, either with the same, or
                           with a different listener. A multicast object listens with only one monitor
                           item at a time.  If the object is actively listening, and its listen method
                           is invoked again, it will throw an IllegalArgumentException.<br><br>
