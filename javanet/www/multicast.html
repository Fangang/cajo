                           </font><br><br>

                           The
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>gnu.cajo.utils.Multicast</a>
                           class performs two complimentary functions. First, it allows an item to
                           "broadcast" a remote reference to itself over the network. Second, it allows
                           items to listen for, and capture, these reference broadcasts. Once captured,
                           a remote item can contact the broadcasting item, if it wishes. The functions
                           operate entirely separately of each other; meaning an item can broadcast
                           without listening, and listen without broadcasting, it can even do both.  If
                           it is listening when it broadcasts, it will even capture its own reference.<br><br>

                           The use of multicasting is application specific; it can be used to join a
                           group of inter-operating items, or it can be used to announce a particular
                           event.  Essentially, it gives items an opportunity to connect to each other,
                           without having to know the IP address' of the listening items beforehand.<br><br>

                           It must be noted that in order for multicasting to work, the network
                           routers must be configured to pass IP multicast packets.  If they are not,
                           the multicasting will work only within the subnet of origination.  There are
                           two parameters on which the items must agree in order to send and receive
                           references between each other.  An IP address and port number define a
                           specific "channel" changing either of which is effectively an entirely
                           different channel.  The UDP/IP address is different from a traditional TCP/IP
                           address in that it doesn't identify a machine (and socket) rather it
                           indicates the machine is a member of a "group".<br><br>

                           An item can listen and broadcast on as many channels as it wants.
                           Implementations could range from performing all multicasts on a single
                           channel, to using separate channels for each specific meaning.  The
                           framework defines a default channel, which can be a useful method for
                           spontaneous inter-networking.  To use a <i>Star Trek</i> metaphor; it could
                           be likened to the <i>'hailing frequency'</i> for contacting new and unknown
                           items.  An item broadcasts by passing a remoted reference to itself, or some
                           other item, to the multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>announce</a> method.<br><br>

                           An item can register itself with a multicast object to listen for these
                           reference broadcasts.  It does this by invoking multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>listen</a> method, passing in a
                           reference to itself.  When the multicast object receives a broadcast of a
                           remote item reference, it will invoke the listener with a string of
                           "multicast", and a reference to itself, as an argument. Logically, a
                           listening object would either implement the following function:
                           <b><pre>   public Object multicast(Multicast m);</pre></b>
                           if it derived from BaseItem, otherwise it would test for the callback in its
                           Invoke method implementation.<br><br>

                           A multicast object has four public members:<ul>
                              <li><code>iaddr   </code> The IP address of the broadcasting item.
                              <li><code>item    </code> The remote reference to the broadcasting item.
                              <li><code>address </code> The address on which this reference was received.
                              <li><code>port    </code> The port on which this reference was received.
                           </ul>The reason for calling the listener with a reference to the multicast
                           object is to allow the possibility for a single listener to listen on
                           multiple multicast objects.  If the listener is listening to only one
                           object, there is no chance of its multicast method being invoked reentrantly.
                           However, if a listener is listening on more than one, the possibility
                           exists for reentrant invocations.<br><br>

                           A listening multicast object checks the return value of its listener's
                           invocation.  If it returns a null, it will continue listening; if the method
                           returns a non-null value, it will stop listening.  To start the object
                           listening again, its <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>listen</a>
                           method must be called, either with the same, or a different listener. The
                           multicast's listen method can only monitor using one listening object at a
                           time.  This means that if the multicast object is actively listening, and its
                           listen method is invoked again, it will throw an <b><code>
                           IllegalArgumentException</code></b>.<br><br>
