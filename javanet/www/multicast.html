                           The
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html>Multicast</a> class performs
                           two complimentary functions. First, it allows an item to <i>"broadcast"</i>
                           a remote reference to itself over the network. Second, it allows an item to
                           listen for, and <i>catch</i>, these reference broadcasts. Once caught, an
                           item can invoke the public methods of the broadcasting item. These two
                           functions operate entirely independently of each other; i.e. an item can
                           broadcast without listening, and listen without broadcasting, it can even
                           do both.  If it is listening when it broadcasts, a VM will even catch its
                           own reference.

                           <h3>Using Multicast</h3><br>

                           The use of multicasting is completely application specific; for example, it
                           can be used to join a group of inter-operating items, or it can be used to
                           announce a particular event.  Essentially, it gives items an opportunity to
                           connect to each other spontaneously, without having to know the host address'
                           of the listening or sending items beforehand. This is particularly useful in
                           DHCP environments, where each machine's host address can be randomly assigned
                           and reassigned.<br><br>

                           There are two parameters on which the items must agree in order to send and
                           receive references between each other.  An IP address and port number define
                           a specific <i>"channel"</i>, to use a radio analogy. Changing either of
                           these values effectively switches to an entirely different channel.  The
                           UDP/IP address is different from a traditional TCP/IP address in that it
                           doesn't identify a specific machine and socket, rather it represents all
                           machines that are a members of a <i>"group"</i>.<br><br>

                           A single item can listen and broadcast on as many channels as it wants.
                           Applications can range from performing all multicasts on a single channel,
                           to using separate channels for each specific meaning. A server performs a
                           broadcast by passing a remoted reference to one of its items to a multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#announce(gnu.cajo.invoke.Remote,%20int)>
                           announce</a> method.<br><br>

                           The framework defines a default channel, which can be useful for spontaneous
                           inter-networking.  To use a <b><i>Star Trek</i></b> metaphor; it could be
                           likened to the <i>'hailing frequency'</i> for contacting new and unknown
                           items. Extracting interface information from spontaneously discovered items
                           is currently application specific; unless there is a strong community
                           interest for its standardization. An official <i>suggestion</i> would be
                           to implement a <code>getDescription()</code> method, which would return a
                           string, describing the features and use of the object in detail, with HTML
                           markup allowed.


                           <h3>Receiving Multicasts</h3><br>

                           An object can register itself with a multicast object to listen for these
                           reference broadcasts.  It does this by invoking the multicast's
                           <a href=docs/gnu/cajo/utils/Multicast.html#listen(java.lang.Object)>
                           listen</a> method, passing in a reference to itself.  When the multicast
                           object receives a broadcast of a remote item reference, it will invoke the
                           listener's public multicast method, passing a reference to itself, as
                           an argument. Logically, a listening object would have to implement the
                           following method:

                           <pre>   public Object multicast(Multicast m);</pre>

                           A multicast object has four public members:<br><br>

                           <table>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>item</b></td>
                                 <td>The remote reference to the broadcasted item.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>iaddr</b></td>
                                 <td>The TCP address of the broadcasting server.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>address</b></td>
                                 <td>The UDP address on which this reference was received.</td>
                              </tr>
                              <tr>
                                 <td><b>port</b></td>
                                 <td>The UDP port on which this reference was received.</td>
                              </tr>
                           </table><br>

                           The reason for calling a listener with a reference to the multicast
                           object is to allow for the possibility of a single objtct to listen with
                           multiple multicast objects.  If the listener is listening with only one
                           Multicast object, there is no chance of its multicast method being invoked
                           reentrantly. However, if a listener is listening on more than one, the
                           possibility exists for reentrant invocation.<br><br>

                           A multicast object checks the return value of its listener's
                           multicast method invocation.  If it returns null, it will continue
                           listening; if the listener returns a non-null value, it will stop
                           listening.  To start the object listening again, its listen method must
                           be called, with either the same, or a different listener.

                           <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>

                           The multicast mechanism creates the possibility for items to spontaneously,
                           and dynamically connect. This allows items to join confederations of items
                           to accomplish larger tasks. Dynamic confederation can provide resilient,
                           adaptive, and fault-tolerant application networks, exhibiting
